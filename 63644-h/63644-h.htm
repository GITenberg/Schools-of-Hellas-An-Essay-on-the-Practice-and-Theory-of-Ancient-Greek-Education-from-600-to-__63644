<h3 class="h3head">PREFACE</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> Dissertation here published was written by the late
Mr. K. J. Freeman, in the course of the year following
his graduation at Cambridge as a Bachelor of Arts, with
a view to his candidature for a Fellowship of Trinity
College, for which purpose the rules of the College
require the production of some original work. In the
summer of 1906, three months before the autumn
election of that year, his brilliant and promising career
was arrested by death.</p>

<p>We have been encouraged to publish the work, as it
was left, by several judgments of great weight; nor
does it, in my opinion, require anything in the nature
of an apology. It is of course, under the circumstances,
incomplete, and it is in some respects immature. But,
within the limits, the execution is adequate for practical
purposes; and the actual achievement has a substantive
value independent of any personal consideration. No
English book, perhaps no extant book, covers the same
ground, or brings together so conveniently the materials
for studying the subject of ancient Greek education&mdash;education
as treated in practice and theory during the
most fertile and characteristic age of Hellas. It would
be regrettable that this useful, though preliminary,
labour should be lost and suppressed, only because it
was decreed that the author should not build upon his
own foundation.</p>

<p>Novelty of view he disclaimed; but he claimed,
<a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a><span class="pageno">viii</span>
with evident truth, that the work is not second-hand,
but based upon wide and direct study of the sources,
which are made accessible by copious references.</p>

<p>The subject is in one respect specially appropriate to
a youthful hand. Perhaps at no time is a man more
likely to have fresh and living impressions about
education than when he has himself just ceased to be
a pupil, when he has just completed the subordinate
stages of a long and strenuous self-culture. It will be
seen, in more than one place, that the author is not
content with the purely historical aspect of his theme,
but suggests criticisms and even practical applications.
It may be thought that these remarks upon a matter of
pressing and growing importance are by no means the
less deserving of consideration because the writer, when
he speaks of the schoolboy and the undergraduate, is
unquestionably an authentic witness.</p>

<p>But, as I have already said, the work will commend
itself sufficiently to those interested in the topic, if only
as a conspectus of facts, presented with orderly arrangement
and in a simple and perspicuous style.</p>

<p>It is not my part here to express personal feelings.
But I cannot dismiss this, the first and only fruit of
the classical studies of Kenneth Freeman, without a
word of profound sorrow for the premature loss of a
most honourable heart and vigorous mind. He was one
whom a teacher may freely praise, without suspicion of
partiality; for, whatever he was, he was no mere product
of lessons, as this, his first essay, will sufficiently
show. It is not what he would have made it; but it
is his own, and it is worthy of him.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">EDITOR’S STATEMENT</h3>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> has fallen to my lot to edit this essay, the first, and
last, work of Kenneth John Freeman, a brilliant young
Scholar of Winchester College and Trinity College,
Cambridge, whose short life closed in the summer of
1906.</p>

<p>He was born in London on June 19, 1882, and
died at Winchester on July 15, 1906,&mdash;a brief span of
twenty-four years, the greater part of which was spent
in the strenuous pursuit of truth and beauty, both in
literature and in the book of Nature, but above all
among the Classics.</p>

<p>Scholarly traditions and interests he inherited in
no small measure: he was the son of Mr. G. Broke
Freeman, a member of the Chancery Bar, and a Classical
graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, and the grandson
of Philip Freeman, Archdeacon of Exeter, himself
a Scholar of the same great Foundation, Craven
University Scholar and Senior Classic in 1839. He
was also a great-grandson of the Rev. Henry Hervey
Baber, for many years Principal Librarian of the British
Museum, and Editor of the <span class="decoration" lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio princeps</span> of the <cite>Codex
Alexandrinus</cite>. From them he inherited a passion for
Classical study, a keen sense of form, and a determined
pursuit of knowledge, which nothing could daunt, not
<a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a><span class="pageno">x</span>
even the recurrent shadow of a long and distressing
illness.</p>

<p>Through his mother, a daughter of Dr. Horace
Dobell, of Harley Street, London, he was also a great-nephew
of the poet Sydney Dobell; and thus he
may well have derived that poetic feeling which distinguished
a number of verses found among his papers,
since printed for private circulation.</p>

<p>His School and University career was uniformly
successful. At Winchester he won prizes in many
subjects and several tongues, and carried off the
Goddard Scholarship, the intellectual blue ribbon, at
the age of sixteen.</p>

<p>At Cambridge he was Browne University Scholar
in 1903, and in the first “division” of the Classical
Tripos in 1904, in which year he also won the Craven
Scholarship. The senior Chancellor’s medal fell to
him in the following year.</p>

<p>There is no need to enumerate his other distinctions,
but the epigram with which he won the Browne Medal
in 1903 is so beautiful in itself and so true an epitome of
the boy and the man, that I am tempted to quote it here:</p>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>He was always an optimist, who regarded life as a
“fair Inn,” which provided much good cheer. Shyness
and ill-health limited sadly the range of his friends, but
not his capacity and desire for “friendship.” “Manly
toil,” both physical and intellectual, was dear to his
<a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a><span class="pageno">xi</span>
soul: thus, though no great athlete, he was an ardent
Volunteer both at School and College, and declared
that, had he not chosen the teacher’s profession, he
would have wished to be a soldier: he writes of Sparta
and Xenophon with evident sympathy. Also he fought
and won many an intellectual battle against great
odds; to quote one instance, he wrote the papers for
his Craven Scholarship while convalescent in his old
nursery. His poems, to complete the parallel, may
justly be described as the “aspiring thoughts” of a
singularly pure and reverent heart.</p>

<p>It is a simple, uneventful record: six happy years as
a Winchester Scholar; three as a Scholar of Trinity
College, Cambridge; one year of travel and study,
mainly devoted to the subject of Education, which
always had a special attraction for him; and lastly,
one year, the happiest of his life, when he returned to
teach at his old school.</p>

<p>All appeared bright and promising; he was doing the
work he desired at the school of his choice, health and
vigour seemed fully restored, and a strenuous life as a
Winchester Master lay before him, when an acute attack
of the old trouble, borne with perfect patience, cut him
off in the prime of his promise.</p>

<p>Then, to quote his own translation of his epigram:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">When I was aweary, last and best</div>
  <div class="i0">They gave me dreamless rest;</div>
  <div class="i0">And sent me on my way that I might come</div>
  <div class="i0">Unknown, unknowing, Home.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The work itself was never finished for the press;
indeed, some chapters, dealing with Sokrates, Plato, and
Aristotle, did not appear sufficiently complete to justify
publication: these, therefore, we have withheld. But
<a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a><span class="pageno">xii</span>
this book is in substance what he left it, and he was
fully aware that the omitted chapters were in need of
further revision.</p>

<p>In any case, it would have been a labour of
love to me to edit this dissertation; but the labour
has been lightened at every turn by the ungrudging
help and friendship of many Scholars. Dr. Verrall,
besides contributing a Preface, has contributed much
advice in general and in detail; Dr. Sandys has revised
the proofs and given me the benefit of his comprehensive
knowledge of the subject; Dr. Henry Jackson
went through some of the later chapters and discussed
points of general interest. The original Essay or the
proofs have in addition been revised, from different
points of view, by Mr. Edmund D. A. Morshead,
late Fellow of New College, Oxford, and Mr. F. M.
Cornford, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
Mr. G. S. Freeman (brother of the author) is responsible
for the Index; while Mr. W. R. H. Merriman
has spent much pains upon verifying the numerous
quotations. In a few cases Dr. F. G. Kenyon’s erudition
came to the rescue. To all these my best thanks are
due. Mr. A. Hamilton Smith of the British Museum
was most helpful in identifying the vases from which
the illustrations are derived. The author, who was a
considerable draughtsman, had drawn scenes from
Greek vases with his own hand; but of course our
illustrations are derived from published reproductions,
with two exceptions. The two British Museum vase-scenes
(Illustrations <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>) were specially drawn
for this book: they have never been carefully reproduced
before. I must thank the Syndics of the Pitt
Press at Cambridge for their kind permission to reproduce
their print of Douris’ Educational Vase from
<a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a><span class="pageno">xiii</span>
Dr. Sandys’ <cite>History of Classical Scholarship</cite>. The
design which appears on the cover of this volume is
also adapted from this vase.</p>

<p>It remains to add a few sentences from a Statement
which the author himself drew up:</p>

<p>“I have,” he says, “confined my attention very
largely for several years to original texts and eschewed
the aid of commentaries.” This will be patent to the
reader.</p>

<p>“As to accepted interpretations, I have, purposely
and on principle, neither read nor heard much of them,
since I wished, in pursuance of the bidding of Plato
himself, not to receive unquestioningly the authority of
those whom to hear is to believe, but to develop views
and interpretations of my own. For I have always
believed that education suffers immensely from the
study of books about books, in preference to the study
of the books themselves. M. Paul Girard’s book in
French (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Éducation Athénienne</cite>) and Grasberger’s in
German (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erziehung und Unterricht im klassischen
Alterthum</cite>), the latter of which I have only read in
part, have set me on the track of authorities whom I
should otherwise have missed, but I believe that my
acknowledgments in the text and in the notes fully
cover my direct obligations to them in other respects,
although my indirect obligations to M. Girard’s stimulating
book, which are great, remain unexpressed.</p>

<p>“An apology is, perhaps, needed for the peculiar, and
not wholly consistent, spelling of the Greek words. I
had meant to employ the Latinised spelling. But when
I came to write Lyceum, Academy, and pedagogue, my
heart failed me. For I did not wish to suggest modern
music-halls, modern art, and, worst of all, modern
‘pedagogy.’ In adopting the ancient spelling I had
<a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a><span class="pageno">xiv</span>
Browning on my side. But again, when I wrote Thoukudides,
my heart sank, for I could hardly recognise an
old friend in such a guise. So I decided, perhaps
weakly, to steer a middle course, and preserve the
Latinised forms in the case of the more familiar words.
Thus I put Plato, not Platon, but Menon and
Phaidon.” We have adhered to this principle in the
main; we need hardly say that Lakedaimon is the
transliteration of a Greek word: Lacedaemonian is
an English adjective. So a citizen of Troizen is a
Troezenian, and of Boiotia a Boeotian. “I have,” the
author concludes, “preferred <em>Hellas</em> and <em>Hellene</em> to
<em>Greece</em> and <em>Greek</em>. For a rose by any other name does
not always smell as sweet.”</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The meeting-place of two streams has always a curious
fascination for the traveller. There is a strange charm
in watching the two currents blend and lose their
individuality in a new whole. The discoloured, foam-flecked
torrent, swirling on remorselessly its pebbles
and minuter particles of granite from the mountains,
and the calm, translucent stream, bearing in invisible
solution the clays and sands of the plains through
which its slow coils have wound, melt into a single
river, mightier than either, which has received and
will carry onward the burdens of both and lay them
side by side in some far-off delta, where they will form
“the dust of continents to be.”</p>

<p>To the student of history or of psychology the
meeting-place of two civilisations has a similar charm.
To watch the immemorial culture of the East, slow-moving
with the weight of years, dreamy with centuries
of deep meditation, accept and assimilate, as in a
moment of time, the science, the machinery, the restless
energy and practical activity of the West is a fascinating
employment; for the process is big with hope of some
glorious product from this union of the two. Those
who live while such a union is in progress cannot estimate
its value or its probable result; they are but
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
conscious of the discomforts and confusion arising from
the ending of the old order that passes away, and can
hardly presage the glories of the new, to which it is
yielding place. It is in past history, not in the contemporary
world, that such combinations must be
studied.</p>

<p>The chief historical instance of two distinct civilisations
blending into one is the Renaissance, that mighty
union of the spirit of ancient Hellas and her pupil
Rome with the spirit of medieval Europe, which has
hardly been perfected even now. But it is often forgotten
that there were at least two dress-rehearsals for
the great drama of the Renaissance, in the course of
which Hellenism learnt its own charm and adapted
itself to the task of educating the world. Alexander
carried the arts, the literature, and the spirit of Hellas
far into the heart of Asia; and, though his great experiment
of blending West with East was interrupted
by his early death and the consequent disruption of his
world-empire, yet, even so, something of his object was
effected in the Hellenistic culture of Alexandria, Syria,
and Asia Minor. Within a century of his death began
the second dress-rehearsal, this time in the West.
Conquered Hellas led her fierce conqueror captive, and
the strength of Rome bowed before the intellect and
imagination of the Hellene. Once more the great
man who designed to unite the two currents into one
stream without loss to either was cut off before his
plans could be carried out, and the murder of Julius
Cæsar caused incalculable damage to this earlier Renaissance,
for the education of Rome, the second
scholar of Hellas, was not too wisely conducted. Yet
the schooling produced Virgil and Horace and that
Greco-Roman civilisation in which the Teutonic nations
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
of the North received their first lessons in culture.
After several premature attempts, medieval Europe
rediscovered ancient Hellas and her pupil Rome at
the time of the Renaissance. Since that time the influence
exerted by Hellenism upon modern civilisation
has been continuous and incalculable. How much of
that influence remains unassimilated, how far it is still
needed, may perhaps be realised best by passing straight
from the Elgin marbles or a play of Sophocles to a
modern crowd or to modern literature.</p>

<p>Hellas has thus been the educator of the world to
an extent of which not even Perikles ever dreamed.
How then, it may naturally be asked, did the teacher
of the nations teach her own sons and daughters? If
so many peoples have been at school to learn the
lessons of Hellenism, what was the nature of the
schools of ancient Hellas? How did those wonderful
city-states, which produced in the course of a few
centuries a wealth of unsurpassed literature, philosophy
and art, whose history is immortalised by the names
of Thermopylae and Marathon, train their young
citizens to be at once patriots and art-critics, statesmen
and philosophers, money-makers and lovers of
literature? They must have known not a little about
education, those old Hellenes, it is natural to suppose.
Have the schools, like the arts and literature and
spirit, of Hellas any lesson for the modern world?
These are the questions which the present work will
attempt in some measure to answer.</p>

<p>In some measure only; for the spirit of Hellas
cannot be caught at second hand: it consists in just
those subtler elements of refined taste and perfect
choice of expression which cannot but be lost in a
translation or a photograph. In like manner, the
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
secret of Hellenic education cannot be reproduced by
any mere accumulation of bald facts and wiseacres’
deductions. It is easy for the modern theorist to give
an exact account of his ideal school; he has only to
tabulate the subjects which are to be studied, the books
which are to be read, and the hours at which his
mechanical children are to be stuffed with the required
mass of facts. But the Hellenic schoolmaster held
that education dealt not with machines but with
children, not with facts but with character. His
object was to mould the taste of his pupils, to make
them “love what is beautiful and hate what is ugly.”
And because he wished them to love what is beautiful
in art and literature, in nature and in human life, he
sought to make his lessons attractive, in order that the
subjects learnt at school might not be regarded with
loathing in after life. Education had to be charming
to the young; its field was largely music and art and
the literature which appeals most to children, adventure
and heroism and tales of romance expressed in verse.
The music is all but gone, and of the art only a
few fragments remain; the primary schools of Hellas
have left to modern research only portions of their
literature. Their attractiveness must be judged from
the poems of Homer. But the charm of education
lies mainly in the methods of the teacher; and of these
posterity can know little. Scholars may piece together
the books which were read and the exercises which
were practised, but of the method in which they were
taught, of their order and arrangement and respective
quantities, nothing can be known. There is the raw
material, the human boy, and of the tools wherewith the
masters fashioned him, some relics are left; but of the
way in which the artist used those tools, of the true
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
inwardness of his handicraft and skill, not all the diligence
of Teutonic research can recover a trace. The
young art-student will learn little of Michel Angelo or
Raphael, if he focusses his attention simply on the
materials and the tools which they employed: to
grasp their spirit he must go to the Sistine Chapel or
to the Dresden Gallery, and contemplate their masterpieces.
In like manner the student of Hellenic education
ought to consider not its materials and tools, but
rather its results and ideals. He must look with his
own eyes and imagination upon the Aegina pediment or
the “Hermes” of Praxiteles, if he wishes to comprehend
the objects of the Doric and Ionic schools. This he must
do for himself, since no book can do it for him. All
that this work can hope to do is to furnish some few
ideas about the tools wherewith the Hellenic schoolmasters
tried to fashion the boys at their disposal into
the masterpieces bodied forth in the “Hermes” and the
Aeginetan figures: the skilled fingers and the imaginative
brains which used the tools are for ever beyond the
reach of the scholar and the archæologist.</p>

<p>The “Hermes,” with his physical perfection and his
plenitude of intellect, with the features of an artist and
the brow of a thinker, may be taken as the ideal of the
fully developed Athenian education of the early fourth
century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> The Aeginetan figures stand in the same
relation to the Spartan and Cretan schools; these heroic
figures have the bodily harmoniousness, the narrow if
deep thought, the hardness of the Dorian temper.
Perhaps it is not fanciful to see in the so-called
“Theseus” of the Parthenon an earlier ideal of
Athenian training, when it aimed at rather less of
dreamy contemplation, at a less sensuous and more
strenuous mode of life. If this be so, that glorious
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
figure bodies forth the very ideal of Periclean and
Imperial Athens at her grandest moment, before the
ruin caused by the long war with Sparta.</p>

<p>The stream of Hellenism ran in two currents.
Underlying the local diversity, which made every little
town ethically and artistically distinct from its neighbour,
was the fundamental difference between Dorian
and Ionian. Clearly marked in every aspect of life,
this difference was most marked in the schools. Sparta
and Crete on the one hand, and Athens, followed
closely by her Ionian and Aeolic allies and at a greater
distance by the rest of civilised Hellas, on the other,
develop totally different types of education. The
young Spartan is enrolled at a fixed age in a boarding-school:
everything he learns or does is under State-supervision.
Perfect grace and harmony of body is
his sole object: he is hardly taught his letters or
numbers. The young Athenian goes to school when
and where his parents like; learns, within certain wide
limits, what they please; ends his schooling when they
choose. He learns his letters and arithmetic, studies
literature and music, and, at a later date, painting,
besides his athletic exercises, at a day-school. When
he grows older, he may add rhetoric or philosophy or
science or any subject he pleases to this earlier course.
The State interferes only to protect his morals, and to
enforce upon him two years of military training between
the ages of eighteen and twenty.</p>

<p>The superficial differences between the Athenian and
the Spartan type of school are so striking that at first
sight they appear to have no one principle in common.
It will therefore be necessary to keep the two types apart
at first and discuss their details separately. But the
Hellenic thinkers recognised certain deep-seated similarities
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
beneath the superficial contradictions, and it
became the object of educational philosophy to blend
the two types into a perfect system. As soon as a
deeper study has been made of the theory of education
in Hellas, the distinctions of practice begin to vanish
away and the similarities of ideal and aim become more
and more apparent. When the survey of both practice
and theory, which is the object of this work, has been
completed, it should be possible to grasp and estimate
the common principles, which, amid much variety of
detail, governed the schools of Hellas.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">EDUCATION AT SPARTA AND IN CRETE</h4>

<p><span class="sc">According</span> to a current legend, which Herodotos,
owing to his Ionian patriotism, is eager to contradict,
Anacharsis the Scythian, on his return from his travels,
declared that the Spartans seemed to him to be the only
Hellenic people with whom it was possible to converse
sensibly, for they alone had time to be wise.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
The
full Spartan citizen certainly had abundant leisure. He
was absolutely free from the cares of money-making,
for he was supported by an hereditary allotment which
was cultivated for him by State-serfs. He had no
profession or trade to occupy him. His whole time
was spent in educating himself and his younger
countrymen in accordance with Spartan ideas, and
in practising the Spartan mode of life. The Spartans
divided their day between various gymnastic and
military exercises, hunting, public affairs, and “leschai”
or conversation-clubs, at which no talk of business
was permitted; the members discussed only what was
honourable and noble, or blamed what was cowardly
and base.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
They were on the whole a grave and silent
people, but they had a terse wit of their own, and there
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
was a statue of Laughter in their city. They were
always in a state of perfect training, like the “wiry
dogs” of Plato’s Republic. They were strong conservatives;
innovation was strictly forbidden. The
unfortunate who made a change in the rules of the
Ball-game was scourged. In the Skias or Council-chamber
still hung in Pausanias’ time the eleven-stringed
lyre which Timotheos had brought to Sparta, only to
have it broken;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
and the nine-stringed lyre of Phrunis
met the same fate. Having once accepted the seven-stringed
lyre from Terpander, the Spartans never permitted
it to be changed. They had also a talent for
minute organisation; both their army and their
children were greatly subdivided. Every one at Sparta
was a part of a beautifully organised machine, designed
almost exclusively for military purposes.</p>

<p>In this strangely artificial State, it was essential
that the future citizens should be saturated with
the spirit of the place at an early age. There were
practically no written laws. Judges and rulers acted
on their own discretion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
This was only possible if a
particular stamp of character, a particular outlook
and attitude, were impressed upon every citizen.
Consequently, education was the most important thing
at Sparta. It was both regulated and enforced by the
State. It was exactly the same for all. The boys were
taken away from home and brought up in great
boarding-schools, so that the individualising tendencies
of family life and hereditary instincts might be stamped
out, and a general type of character, the Spartan type,
alone be left in all the boys. For boarding-schools
have admittedly this result, that they impose a recognisable
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
stamp, a certain similarity of manner and attitude,
upon all the boys who pass through them.</p>

<p>Therefore, as soon as a child was born at Sparta, it
was taken before the elders of the tribe to which its
parents belonged.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
If they decided that it was likely
to prove sickly, it was exposed on Mount Taügetos,
there to die or be brought up by Helots or Perioikoi.
Sparta was no place for invalids. If the infant was
approved, it was taken back to its home, to be brought
up by its mother. Spartan women were famous for
their skill in bringing up children. Spartan nurses
were in great demand in Hellas. They were eagerly
sought after for boys of rank and wealth like Alkibiades.
The songs which they sang to their charges and the
rules which they enforced made the children “not
afraid of the dark” or terrified if they were left alone;
not addicted “to daintiness or naughty tempers or
screaming”; in fact, “little gentlemen” in every way.</p>

<p>No doubt the discipline of the children was strict,
but then the parents lived just as strictly themselves.
There were no luxuries for any one at Sparta: the
houses and furniture were as plain as the food. But
there is a charming picture of Agesilaos riding on a
stick to amuse his children; and the Spartan mothers,
if stern towards cowardice, seem to have been keenly
interested in their children’s development; they were
by no means nonentities like Athenian ladies.</p>

<p>The children slept at home till they were seven;
but at an early age were taken by their fathers to
the “Pheiditia” or clubs where the grown men spent
those hours during which they stayed indoors and took
their meals. About fifty men attended each of these
clubs. The children sat on the floor near their fathers.
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
Each member contributed monthly a “medimnos” of
barley-meal, eight “choes” of wine, five “mnai” of
cheese, two and a half “mnai” of figs,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
and some very
cheap relish; if he sacrificed to a god, he gave part of
the victim to his “mess,” and if he was successful in
hunting (which was a frequent occupation), he brought
his spoils to the common table. There was also the
famous black broth, made by the hereditary guild of
State cooks, which only a life of Spartan training and
cold baths in the Eurotas could make appetising; yet
elderly Spartans preferred it to meat. Perhaps a
fragment of Alkman represents a high-day at one of
these clubs: “Seven couches and as many tables, brimming
full of poppy-flavoured loaves, and linseed and
sesamum, and in bowls honey and linseed for the
children.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>A Spartan who became too poor to pay his contribution
to his club lost his rights as a citizen, and so could
not have his children educated in the State-system.
But as long as the allotments were not alienated, such
cases were not common. The contribution was <ins title="kata kephalên">κατὰ
κεφαλήν</ins>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
that is, the fixed quantity of provisions had
to be supplied for every member of the family who
attended a club, <span class="decoration">i.e.</span> for every male, since the women
took their meals at home. There is no reason whatever
for supposing that the boys, either before or after
they went to the boarding-schools, were fed at the
expense of the State. It is expressly stated that the
number of foster-children, who accompanied their
benefactors’ sons to school, varied according to the
extent of their patron’s means.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
Parents must therefore
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
have paid something for their boys while they were
at school. The teaching involved no expenses; hence
it must have been the food for which they paid.
Thus, only those boys could attend the Spartan schools
whose parents could afford to pay the customary subscription
in kind for their own and their children’s food
at the common meals. Xenophon, the admirer of all
things Spartan, adopts the same system in his State,
since he makes the children of the poor drop out
automatically from the public schools. It must be
remembered that at Sparta families were always small,
and the population tended to decrease steadily; the
number of males for whom subscriptions had to be paid
by the head of the family can rarely have been large.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, therefore, the Spartan schools
were only for the sons of “Peers” (<ins title="hómoioi">ὅμοιοι</ins>),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
that
is, those who paid the subscriptions. But a certain
number of other boys were admitted, provided that
their food was paid for. A rich Spartan might, if he
chose, select certain other boys to be educated with his
own son or sons, and pay their expenses meanwhile.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
The number of these school-companions depended on
the number of contributions in kind which he was
capable of supplying. The school-companions could
thus attend the Spartan schools; but they did not
become citizens when they grew up, unless they revealed
so much merit that the Spartan State gave them the
franchise.</p>

<p>From what classes were these school-companions
drawn? Sometimes they were foreigners, sons either
of distinguished guest-friends of leading Spartans, or
of refugee-settlers in Laconia. Thus Xenophon’s
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
two sons were educated at Sparta. These foreign boys
were called <ins title="tróphimoi">τρόφιμοι</ins> or Foster-children. Xenophon
mentions “foreigners from among the <ins title="tróphimoi">τρόφιμοι</ins>.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
If these Foster-children, when grown up, remained in
Sparta they possessed no civic rights. A passage in
Plato refers to the difficulty which was experienced
in getting these Foster-children to accept this humble
position.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
It is interesting to note that Sparta thus
precedes Athens as an educational centre to which boys
from foreign cities came to receive their schooling.</p>

<p>More often Spartan parents chose Helots to be
school-companions of their sons. Thus Plutarch
speaks of “two of the foster-brothers of Kleomenes,
whom they call Mothakes.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
The name Mothax was
applied to these educated Helots. They seem to have
been notorious for the way in which they presumed
upon their position, if we may assume a connection
between Mothax and Mothon, a term which is used
for the patron deity of impudence in Aristophanes, and
elsewhere is the name of a vulgar dance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
They were
not enfranchised when their school-days were over, and
had to settle down to slavish duties, unless they showed
peculiar merit. But several of the most distinguished
Spartans, including Lusandros, were enfranchised
Mothakes.</p>

<p>Xenophon, in a passage which has already been
quoted, mentions “gentlemen-volunteers of the
Perioikoi and certain foreigners of the so-called
Foster-children and bastards of the Spartiatai, very
goodly men and not without share in the honourable
things in the State.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
If most of the authorities are
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
right in regarding “the honourable things”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
as a
Spartan phrase for their educational system&mdash;and there
is good ground for this view&mdash;then this passage shows
that illegitimate sons, and perhaps eminent Perioikoi,
passed through the public schools at Sparta although,
however, neither were called Foster-children, a name
reserved for distinguished foreigners. The Helots
who shared the education were known as Mothakes,
and sometimes as <ins title="syntrophoi">σύντροφοι</ins>, school-companions; but
they do not seem to have been called <ins title="trophimoi">τρόφιμοι</ins>,
“Foster-children.”</p>

<p>During the best period of Spartan history, none of
these extra pupils, <ins title="trophimoi">τρόφιμοι</ins>, Mothakes, illegitimate
children, and eminent Perioikoi, were enfranchised
unless they showed peculiar merit. At a later date,
perhaps, any one who passed through the schools became
a Spartan citizen. Plutarch makes this a part of
Lukourgos’ system; but that is improbable. Such a
custom would only arise in the days of Spartan decay
and depopulation. On the other hand, any Spartan
boys who flinched before the hardships of their national
education, lost their status, and were disfranchised, if
they did not persevere.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Till they were seven, the boys were taken to
their fathers’ clubs: the girls had all their meals with
their mothers at home, for the women did not have
dining-clubs. By seeing the hardships which their
fathers endured, and hearing their discussions on
political subjects and their terse humour, the boys were
already being trained in the Spartan mode of life; for
the clubs served as an elementary school. There, too,
they learnt to play with their contemporaries, and to
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
exchange rough jests without flinching. To take a
jest without annoyance was part of the Spartan character;
but if the jester went too far for endurance, he
might be asked to stop.</p>

<p>At seven the boys were taken away from home, and
organised in a most systematic way into “packs” and
“divisions.” These were the “ilai,” which probably
contained sixty-four boys, and the “agelai,” whose
numbers are unknown.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>
These packs fed together,
slept together on bundles of reeds for bedding, and
played together. The boys had to go barefoot always,
and wore only a single garment summer and winter
alike. They were all under the control of a
“Paidonomos” or “Superintendent of the boys,”
a citizen of rank, repute, and position, who might at
any moment call them together, and punish them
severely if they had been idle: he had attendants who
bore the ominous name of Floggers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
So, as Xenophon
grimly remarks, a spirit of discipline and obedience
prevailed at Sparta. In order that the boys might not
be left without control, even when the Paidonomos was
absent, any citizen who might be passing might order
them to do anything which he liked, and punish them
for any faults which they committed. The most
sensible and plucky boy in each pack was made a
Prefect over it, and called the Bouâgor, or “Herd-leader”;
the rest obeyed his orders and endured his
punishments.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
The elder men stirred up quarrels among the boys
in order to see who was plucky. Over every school
was set one of the young men over twenty who had a
good reputation both for courage and for morality.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
He was called the Eiren. He kept an eye on their
battles, and used them as servants at home for his
supper; he ordered the bigger boys to bring him
firewood, and the smaller to collect vegetables. The
only way by which such supplies could be obtained was
by stealing them from the gardens and the men’s
dining-clubs. Apparently, then, the boys dined with
him in his house;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
they were supplied with a scanty
meal by their parents to eat there, and were encouraged
to make up the deficiency by stealing. “When the
Eiren had finished supper, he ordered one of the boys
to sing, and to another he propounded some question
which needed a thoughtful answer, such as, ‘Who is
the best of the grown-ups?’ For such particular
questions are more stimulating than generalities like
‘What is virtue?’ or ‘What is a good citizen?’
The answer had to be accompanied by a concise reason;
failure was punished by a bite on the hand. Elder
men watched, saying nothing at the time, but rebuking
the Eiren severely afterwards if he was too strict or
too lenient.”</p>

<p>Thus we find at Sparta a prefect-system and fagging.
But the sense of responsibility produced in the elder boys
at English public schools and the practice which they
acquire in exercising authority were prevented at Sparta
by the perpetual presence of grown men, which made
Laconian schools more like French Lycées. There is
no class of professional schoolmasters; the Eiren, the
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
Paidonomos, and any elder who chooses, give the instruction
freely and gratuitously. Education, being so
simple, cost nothing at Sparta.</p>

<p>From Plutarch’s mention of stealing from the <em>men’s</em>
dining-clubs it may safely be inferred that boys of this
age dined apart. Whether it was always in the Eiren’s
house cannot be ascertained. After the age of sixteen
they must have come into the men’s syssitia; for
Xenophon implies that the visitor to Sparta could see
lads of that age at dinner and ask them questions: and
a visitor would certainly not have dined in a dining-room
meant only for boys. Whether the election of
members took place at that age, or whether they still
went to their fathers’ clubs, is unknown.</p>

<p>The education was almost entirely physical. Plutarch,
it is true, says that they learnt “letters, because they
were useful.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
This may have been a later introduction,
or perhaps the amount learnt was so little as to
justify Isokrates in saying that the Spartans “do not
even learn their letters, which are the means to a knowledge
of the past, as well as of contemporary events”;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>

he also thought it highly improbable that even “the
most intelligent of them would hear of his speeches,
unless they found some one to read them aloud.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
They
had, indeed, little reason to learn to read. Their written
laws were very few, and these they learnt by heart, set
to a tune. They had nothing to do with commerce or
even with accounts; very few of them knew how to
count.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
Hippias, the Sophist, found that all they cared
to listen to, were “genealogies of men and heroes,
foundations of cities, and archæology generally.”
Probably, like the Dorian philosopher Pythagoras, and
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
like Plato, the admirer of all things Dorian, they held
that memory was all-important, and that the use of
writing weakened it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
Besides the State-laws set to
music there were songs which praised dead heroes and
derided cowards: the diction was plain and simple, the
subjects grave and moral; many of them were war-marches;
all were incentive to pluck and energy.</p>

<p>Rhetoric was, of course, utterly forbidden: a young
man who learnt it abroad and brought it home was
punished by the Ephors.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
Spartans learned to be silent as
a rule; when they spoke, their remarks were short and
much to the point, for they thought it wrong to waste
a word.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
This was definitely taught to the boys, as has
been shown above. “If you converse with quite an
ordinary Laconian,” says Plato,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
 “at first he seems a
mere fool; then suddenly, at the critical point, he flings
forth a pithy saying, and his companions seem no better
than children compared with him.” This epigrammatic
wisdom Plato ironically ascribes to the fact that
Laconians really attend Sophists on the sly, and are
greater philosophers than any one knows. Many echoes
of their terse and grim humour have come down to
modern times: such as Leonidas’ remark to his troops
at Thermopylae, “Breakfast here: supper in Hades”;
and the Spartan’s description of Athens, “All things
noble there,” by which he meant that nothing, however
base, was counted ignoble.</p>

<p>The Spartans must not be regarded as wholly averse
to literature. They knew Homer, and thought him the
best poet of his class, although the manner of life he
inculcated was Ionic, not Doric.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>
Alkman spent his
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
life at Sparta, and has left one splendid song for a
chorus of Laconian girls. Aristophanes could put a
fine chorus into the mouths of Laconians, though its
subject is noticeably warlike. For it was war-poems
that the Spartans liked. “They care naught for the
other poets,” says the Athenian orator, Lukourgos,
“but for Turtaios they care so exceedingly that they
made a law to summon every one to the king’s tent,
when they are on a campaign, to hear the poems of
Turtaios, considering that this would make them most
ready to die for their country.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
</p>

<p>After all, the objects of the Spartan education
were not intellectual acuteness and the accumulation of
knowledge, but discipline, endurance, and victory in
war. Discipline was taught by the perpetual presence
of authority, and by very severe punishments. Spartan
boys were practically never left to their own devices:
perhaps that is the secret of the moral failure of nearly
every Spartan who was given a position of authority
outside Lakedaimon; for responsibility requires practice.
Endurance was taught by their whole mode of life.
They went barefooted, with a single garment, played
and danced naked under the hot Laconian sun;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
there
were no ointments or luxurious baths for their bodies,
only the Eurotas for a swim, and a bundle of reeds for
a bed. The food which the boys received was very
scanty: often they were turned out into the country in
the early morning to provide food for themselves for
the whole day by stealing.</p>

<p>This organised stealing was a feature of Spartan
education. At an early age, as we have seen, the
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
small boys were sent out to steal firewood and vegetables
for the Eiren who had charge of them. Later
they were driven out into the country, to forage for
themselves at the expense of the farms. There was a
definite age at which it was customary to begin stealing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
The articles which might be stolen were fixed by
law, and the legal limits might not be transgressed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
It must be remembered that much property in
Laconia was held in common. Any one, for instance,
who was belated while hunting might take what food he
pleased from a country house, and even break open seals
to get at provisions. The Spartans also used one
another’s dogs and horses freely, without permission.
It is therefore absurd to say that the system taught the
boys to be dishonest. If the State agrees to declare certain
articles to be common property, it is no longer stealing
if one citizen removes them from the house of another:
he is no more dishonest than a man who picks blackberries
or buttercups in England. At one of the English
public schools, tooth-mugs used to be a recognised
article of plunder. The small fags were expected to
keep their particular dormitory supplied with them, at
the expense of others. They were punished by the
wronged dormitory if caught in the act of removing
them: but ingenuity in such thefts was regarded as
praiseworthy. There was a certain number of these
mugs belonging to the whole house; they were common
property, and could therefore be purloined without
dishonesty.</p>

<p>Moreover, this system of legalised robbery had a
valuable educational object at Sparta. It was excellent
training in scouting, laying ambushes, and foraging, all
of which it is very important that a future soldier
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
should learn. Xenophon, a soldier himself, notices this,
and in the <cite>Anabasis</cite>, when he needs a clever strategist, he
selects a Spartan because he has been educated in this
way. Since this was the object of the system, the boys,
if caught, were flogged, not for stealing, but for stealing
clumsily. Isokrates declares that skill in robbery was
the road to the highest offices at Sparta. “If any
one can show that this is not the branch of education
which the Lacedaemonians regard as the most important,”
he adds, “I admit that I have not spoken a
word of truth in my life.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
</p>

<p>These foraging expeditions of the boys prepared
them for the similar, if more arduous, duties of “Secret
Service”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
which awaited them between eighteen and
twenty. Young men of this age were sent in bands
to the different districts of Laconia for long periods,
during which they hid in the woods, slept on the ground,
attended to their own wants without a servant, and
wandered about the country by day and night.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
When
it appeared good to them or their chiefs they made
sudden attacks on the Helots, and slaughtered those
who seemed ambitious enough to be dangerous, the
Ephors declaring war on their serfs yearly in order that
there might be no blood-guiltiness attached to these
assassinations.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
There was a regular officer set over this
secret police, who no doubt directed where the particular
youths should go.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
At a critical moment of the Peloponnesian
War, 2000 of the bravest and most ambitious
Helots suddenly “disappeared,” probably by this means.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
But Plato recognised the educational value of such a
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
system, if the murders were omitted. In his <cite>Laws</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>

he institutes a force of <ins title="kryptoi">κρυπτοί</ins>, 720 in number, who
patrol the whole country, taking the twelve districts in
turn, so as to gain a complete acquaintance with it.
They have all the farm-servants and beasts at their disposal,
for digging trenches, making fortifications, roads,
embankments, and reservoirs, for irrigation works and
the like. The similarity of name suggests similarity
of functions, but how much of this the <ins title="kryptoi">κρυπτοί</ins> at
Sparta did cannot be fixed. Probably their chief work
was to keep watch over the subject populations,
Perioikoi and Helots, who were otherwise left almost
entirely to their own devices.</p>

<p>In their institutions of the foraging parties and
Secret Service, the Spartans show a clear appreciation of
boy-nature, as well as a keen eye for methods of military
training. Moderns are beginning to realise that the
average boy has so much of the primitive and natural
man in him that, unless he is permitted to “go wild”
and live the savage life at intervals, he is apt to become
riotous and lawless. Hence in recent days the institution
of camps for boys in England and “Seton Indians”
in America. The Spartans, alone of Hellenes, fully
recognised this peculiarity of boys, and met it with the
foraging expeditions and secret service. The Athenian
boy was not thus provided for until he became an
ephebos; hence the Athenian streets were full of
young Hooligans, while the aristocratic lads developed
more refined, if more vicious, methods of giving vent
to their instincts. In these country-expeditions alone
the Spartan boys had an opportunity of escaping from
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
the presence of their elders and developing habits of
self-reliance and responsibility. Had Sparta made better
use of these opportunities, the fate of her Empire after
Aigospotamoi might have been different.</p>

<p>A frequent occupation of all ages at Sparta was
hunting. This, too, they recognised to be an excellent
training for soldiers, since it involved courage
in meeting wild beasts, skill and ingenuity in tracking
them, and hardships of all sorts in the forests and on
the mountains. Laconia was full of game, and
Laconian hounds were famous. The successful huntsman
gave what he had killed to enrich the meals of
his dining-club, and so won much popularity.</p>

<p>Spartan boys must also have learnt to ride, for they
had to go in procession on horseback at the festival of
Huakinthos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
They were taught to swim, too, by
their daily plunge in the Eurotas. A great part of
their time was spent in gymnastics, under the close
inspection of their elders. Boxing and the pankration
were forbidden to the young Spartan, probably because
they developed a few particular muscles at the expense
of the others.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span>
For wrestling no scientific trainers
were allowed; the Spartan type depended solely on
strength and activity, not on technical skill; so a Spartan,
when beaten by a wrestler from another country, said
his opponent was not a better man, but only a cleverer
wrestler.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
Gladiators, such as those mentioned in
Plato’s <cite>Laches</cite> as teaching the use of arms, were not
permitted at Sparta; these, however, seem to have been
unpractical theorists, quite useless in battle, as General
Laches shows by a funny anecdote about one of
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span>
No lounging spectators were permitted in
Spartan gymnasia; the rule was “strip or withdraw.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
The eldest man in each gymnasium had to see that
every one took sufficient exercise to work off his food
and prevent him from becoming puffy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span>
The physical
condition of the boys was inspected every ten days by
the Ephors,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
while the competitions of the epheboi
seem to have been controlled by a special board, the
Bidiaioi, who figure in inscriptions.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
Aristotle says
of the whole Spartan discipline that it made the boys
“beast-like,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span>
but admits that it did not produce the
one-sided athlete, so common in Hellas, who looked
solely to athletics, and was too much specialised to be
good for anything else. Xenophon<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span>
says that it would
be hard to find anywhere men with more healthy or
more serviceable bodies than the Spartiatai. The most
beautiful man in the Hellenic army at Plataea was a
Spartan.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>
The Spartan boys’ manners were in some
ways surprisingly maidenlike. When they went along
the highway, they kept their hands under their coat,
and walked in silence, keeping their eyes fixed on the
ground before their feet. They spoke as rarely as a
statue and looked about them less than a bronze
figure: they were as modest as a girl. When they
came into the mess-room, you could rarely hear them
even answer a question.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Fighting was encouraged at all ages; there were
organised battles, somewhat resembling football matches,
for the epheboi, in a shady playing-field surrounded by
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
rows of plane trees and encircled by streams, access
to it being given by two bridges. After a night
spent in sacrifice, two teams of epheboi proceeded
to this field. When they came near it, they drew
lots, and the winners had the choice of bridges
by which to enter the ground, selecting no doubt in
accordance with the direction of sun and wind, as a
modern football captain, who has won the toss, selects
the end of the ground from which he will start playing.
The epheboi fought with their hands, kicked, bit, and
even tore out one another’s eyes, in the endeavour to
drive the opposing team back into the water.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The grown men were also encouraged to fight
by the following device. The Ephors selected three
of them, who were called Hippagretai. Each of these
three selected one hundred companions, giving a public
explanation in each case why he chose one man
and rejected the others. So those who had been
rejected became foes to those who were selected, and
kept a close watch over them for the slightest breach
of the accepted code of honour. Each party was
always trying to increase its strength or perform some
signal service to the State, in order to strengthen its
own claims. The rivals also fought with their fists
whenever they met.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This systematised pugnaciousness at Sparta presents
an interesting parallel to the German University duels
and to the fights which used to be almost daily
occurrences in the life of an English schoolboy. Most
of the older English public schools can still show the
special ground which was the recognised scene of these
battles.</p>

<p>Floggings were exceedingly common at Sparta.
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
Any elder man might flog any boy. It was not
etiquette for boys to complain to their parents in these
cases; if they did so, they received a second thrashing.
But the triumph of this system was the flogging of the
“epheboi” yearly at the altar of Artemis Orthia, in
substitute for human sacrifice. Entrance for the competition
was quite voluntary, but competitors seem
always to have been forthcoming even down to
Plutarch’s days. They began by practice of some sort
in the country.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
The altar was covered with blood; if
the floggers were too lenient to some “ephebos” owing
to his beauty or reputation, the statue, according to the
legend, performed a miracle in order to show its displeasure.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span>
The competitors were often killed on the
spot; but they never uttered a groan.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span>
The winner
was called the “altar-victor” (<ins title="bômonikês">βωμονίκης</ins>) and an
inscription still records such a victory.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The girls at Sparta were also organised into agelai
or “packs.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>
They took their meals at home, but
otherwise lived a thoroughly outdoor life. They had
to train their bodies no less than the boys, in order that
they might bear strong children, so they took part in
contests of strength as well as of speed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>
They shared
in the gymnasia and in the musical training. Among
their sports were wrestling, running, and swimming;
they were exposed to sun and dust and toil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span>
They
learned to throw the diskos and the javelin;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span>
they
wore only the short Doric “chiton” with split sides.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span>
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
They went in procession at festivals like the boys; at
certain festivals they danced and sang in the presence of
the young men, praising the brave among them and
jeering at the cowards. At the Huakinthia the maidens
raced on horseback. Theokritos makes a band of 240
maidens, “all playmates together, anoint themselves
like men and race beside the Eurotas.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span>
That passage
also gives wool-work to Laconian maidens (which is
probably untrue, being contradicted by Plato),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
and
lyre-playing, which is contradicted by a Laconian in
Plutarch, who says that “such rubbish is not Laconian.”
The result of all this outdoor training was great
physical perfection: Lampito, the Spartan woman in
Aristophanes’ <cite>Lusistrata</cite>, is greatly admired by the
women from other cities for her beauty, her complexion,
and her bodily condition: “she looks as though she
could throttle a bull.” She ascribes it to her gymnastics
and vigorous dancing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span>
The girls till they married
wore no veil, and mixed freely with the young men;
in fact, there was one dance where they met in modern
fashion; first the youth danced some military steps,
and then the maiden danced some of a suitable sort.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>
Consequently love-matches were far more possible at
Sparta than elsewhere in Hellas. After marriage
the women had to wear veils, and remained at home;
gymnastics, dances, and races ceased.</p>

<p>The Spartans were intensely fond of dancing, but it
must be remembered that they often called dancing
what moderns would call drill. For war was almost a
form of dance; they marched or charged into battle to
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
the notes of the flute, crowned and wearing red cloaks.
The march tunes were in frequent use in Sparta, no
doubt at military exercises. Every day the epheboi
were drawn up in ranks, one behind the other, and
went through military evolutions and dancing figures
alternately, while a flutist played to them and beat time
with his foot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>
This is simply musical drill. The
great national festival of the Gumnopaidia was very
similar. Three great battalions, consisting respectively
of old men, young men, and boys, drawn up in rank
and file, exhibited various movements, chiefly of a
gymnastic sort, singing the songs of Thaletas and
Alkman and Dionusodotos the while and indulging in
impromptu jesting at one another’s expense, after the
fashion of a rustic revel-chorus in Attica. Sometimes
the battalions appeared one by one, and were “led out”
like an army, by the Ephors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>
On other occasions all
three were drawn up in crescent formation side by side,
with the boys in the middle. The festival must have
closely resembled the public parades of the gymnastic
clubs in Switzerland. There were posts of honour and
dishonour, as in battle, cowards usually receiving the
latter. But Agesilaos, the king, once received an
inferior station after his victory at Corinth, and turned
the insult by a jest, “Well thought of, chorus-leader:
that’s the way to give honour to the post.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span>
Then
there was the war-dance, imitating all the actions of
battle, a sort of manual and bayonet exercise, but
accompanied by much acting and by music. Every
Spartan boy began to learn this as soon as he was five.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>
It was done in quick time, if we may judge by the
“Pyrrhic” or war-dance foot ( <sub>˘ ˘</sub> ). There was also
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
a wrestling-dance,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_74" id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span>
and most gymnastics were done
to the accompaniment of the flute. In fact, chorus-dancing
was a regular part of the education of Spartans
and Cretans: the only experience of singing which
most of them possessed was acquired in this way.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_75" id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span>
It is
true that elegiacs were sung as solos before the king’s
tent on campaigns, and at meals, when the victor got
a particularly good slice of meat; but probably this
accomplishment was confined to a few. Aristotle asserts
that the Laconians did not learn songs, but claimed
nevertheless to be able to distinguish good from bad.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Such was the Spartan system of education. To an
Englishman their schools have a greater interest than
those of any other ancient State. Sparta produced the
only true boarding-schools of antiquity. The “packs”
of the Spartan boys, like the English public schools,
formed miniature States, to whose corporate interests
and honour each boy learned to make his own wishes
subservient. Spartan boys, too, like our own, had
the smaller traits of individuality rubbed off them by
the publicity and perpetual intercourse with others
involved in the boarding-school system, in order that
the racial characteristics might the more emerge in
them. They, too, learnt endurance by hardship, and
were early trained both to rule and to obey by means
of the institution of prefects and fagging. But here
the resemblance stops short. The Spartans, like most
other nations, were not prepared to pay the price at
which alone an education in responsibility can be
obtained, the price which lies in the possible ruin of
all the boys who are not strong enough to be a law
to themselves. They very rarely left the boys to
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
themselves without grown men to look after them.
They were always interfering and supervising, instead
of leaving the prefects to exercise their authority. And
so, when Spartans were sent abroad to govern cities
or command armies, having had no practice in responsibility,
they failed shamefully and ignominiously.
But this is equally true of the Athenians and of other
Hellenes. The Spartans deserve all credit for their
experiments with the boarding-school system.</p>

<p>But the system which they adopted had many
faults, besides that which has already been noticed.
There was no individual attention for the boys.
The hardships were excessive and brutalising. While
the boys’ bodies were developed and trained almost to
perfection, their minds were almost entirely neglected:
hence the stupidities of Spartan policy and the
lack of imagination which their statesmen showed.
It was impossible to over-eat or over-drink under the
Spartan system, so the young Spartan had no experience
in self-restraint.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span>
The gymnasia and dining-clubs
caused a great deal of quarrelling (which the Spartan
authorities welcomed), and of immorality (which was
very strictly forbidden); the Spartan gymnasia erred
less, however, in this latter respect than the Athenian.
In war the Spartans were only invincible so long as
they were the only trained troops in Hellas; the rise
of professional armies ruined them, for they could not
adapt themselves to new circumstances. They produced
no art and very little literature, if any. But their
whole State was as much a work of art as a Doric
temple, and of very much the same order, with its
symmetry and regularity, its sacrifice of detail to the
whole, its strength and restraint. It was also the
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
inspiration of at least one great piece of literature,
Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite>.</p>

<p>If courage was their sole object, as perhaps it was,
they succeeded in obtaining it. The coward was a
rare, and a most unhappy bird at Sparta. Mothers on
several occasions killed sons who returned home from
a campaign disgraced. “No one would mess with a
coward, or consort with him. When rival teams were
chosen for the game of ball, he was omitted. In dances
he received the post of dishonour. He was avoided in
the streets. No one would sit next to him. He could
not find a husband for his daughters or a wife for
himself,” and was punished for these offences. “He
was beaten if he imitated his betters in any way.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span>
If the Hellenes were a nation of children, as the old
Egyptian called them, the Spartans were at least a
manly sort of schoolboy. They deified the schoolboy
virtues, pluck and endurance. If we wish to see how
far their education, in its best days, enabled them to
prove true to their ideals, let us consider those 300
at Thermopylae waiting, with jests on their lips, for
the onset of Oriental myriads, and remember that
finest of all epitaphs, of which English can give no
rendering, written upon their memorial in the pass in
honour of their obedience unto <span class="lock">death&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Cretan system of education was very similar
in many ways to the Spartan. In both localities the
teaching was given by any elder member of the
community who chose, not by a professional and paid
class of masters. But in Crete education cost the
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
parent even less than at Sparta; for the boys were
fed largely at public cost.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span>
But so was every other
Cretan, male and female alike. Each community possessed
large public estates, cultivated by public serfs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span>
The revenues thus accruing to the State were applied
to the expenses of government, which were small, and to
the food-supply of all citizens. Thus men, women,
and children were all fed mainly at public cost. It
may be noted, however, that there is no question of
providing the children of improvident parents with
meals at the expense of more provident citizens. Moreover,
the heads of families, who each possessed an
allotment, as at Sparta, had to contribute a tenth of the
produce of their estates.</p>

<p>The women-folk took their meals at home,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>
although
the cost of their food was mainly defrayed by the
public revenues. The men took their meals in dining-clubs
(<ins title="andreia">ἀνδρεῖα</ins>). The whole population of each community
was divided into clubs of this sort, apparently
on the family basis, so that two or three families made
up a club between them, to which their children and
descendants would in turn belong. All the males of
the family attended these meals; small children, boys,
and young men as well as elders are all mentioned as
being present at the same dinners.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span>
The club is only
an enlarged family party. The small children sat on the
ground behind their fathers; they waited on themselves
and on their elders, but the general superintendence of
cooking and attendance was in the hands of a woman
with three or four public slaves and some underlings
in her control.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span>
As they grew older, the sons sat
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
beside their fathers. Boys ordinarily received half
what their parents had; but orphans were allowed the
full quantity at their dead father’s club.</p>

<p>Thus the Cretan club was an amalgamation of
several families into a sort of clan, whose male
members all dined together. All the boys of the
clan formed one boarding-school. They all slept
in one room, perhaps attached to the dining-hall;
there was always a dormitory attached to each of these
buildings for visitors from other cities, so it would
be natural to expect a dormitory for the children also.
The boys took their meals in the club dining-hall, in
the presence of their elders, by whose improving
conversations upon politics and morals they were
supposed to be educated. These elder members elected
one of their number to serve as <ins title="paidonomos">παιδονόμος</ins> or “Superintendent
of the boys” of their club.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span>
Under his
directions the boys learned letters “in moderation”:
they were constantly practised in gymnastics, in the
use of arms, especially the bow, which was a great
Cretan weapon, and in the war-dances, the Kuretic and
Pyrrhic, both indigenous in Crete. They learned the
laws of their country set to a sort of tune, in order
that their souls might be drawn by the music, and also,
that they might more easily remember them. In this
way, if they did anything which was forbidden, they
had not the excuse of ignorance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span>
Besides this, they
were taught hymns to the gods, and praises of good
men. The favourite metre for these purposes was the
Cretic (&ndash; <sub>˘</sub> &ndash;), which was regarded as “severe” and
so suitable for teaching courage and restraint.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span>
The
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
Pæan was their chief national form of song. Cretan
boys were also practised in that terse and somewhat
humorous style of speaking which we have already
seen at Sparta.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Cretan boys were always fighting either single
combats or combined battles against the boys of
another club-school. They were taught endurance by
many hardships. They wore only a short coat in
summer and winter alike. They learnt to despise
heat and cold and mountain paths and the blows which
they received in gymnasia and in fighting.</p>

<p>They remained in the club-schools till their
seventeenth year,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span>
when they became epheboi and celebrated
their escape from the garb of childhood by a
special festival.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span>
Like their contemporaries at Athens,
the epheboi took a special oath of allegiance to the
State and hatred towards its enemies. A fragment
still survives of the oath taken by the epheboi of
Dreros, near Knossos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span>
At seventeen the epheboi were
collected into “packs” (<ins title="agelai">ἀγέλαι</ins>) by private enterprise.
A rich and distinguished young ephebos would gather
round him as large a pack of his contemporaries as he
could; their numbers no doubt depended partly on his
wealth, and still more on his personal popularity. The
aristocratic element in this arrangement is very noticeable,
as in all the institutions of Crete as contrasted
with Sparta. The father of this young chief usually
acted as leader of the pack (<ins title="agelatês">ἀγελάτης</ins>); he possessed
full authority over them and could punish them as he
pleased. He led them out on hunting expeditions and
to the “Runs” (<ins title="dromoi">δρόμοι</ins>), that is, the gymnasia of the
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
epheboi. Cretans who had not yet entered a pack of
epheboi were excluded from these runs (<ins title="apodromoi">ἀπόδρομοι</ins>);
when they entered, they were called “members of
packs” (<ins title="agelastoi">ἀγέλαστοι</ins>).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span>
The pack-leader could collect
his followers where he pleased;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span>
very possibly the
epheboi did not attend the club dinners ordinarily, but
fed or slept either at their patron’s house (whence the
need of a rich pack-leader) or in some special room.
They thus corresponded closely to the Spartan boys of
a younger age under their Eiren. Their food was
supplied, like that of all Cretans, largely out of the
public revenues. On certain fixed days “pack” joined
battle with “pack” to the sound of the lyre and flutes
and in regular time, as was the custom in war; fists,
clubs, and even weapons of iron might be used. It
was a regular institution, half dance, half field-day, with
fixed rules and imposed by law. These battles must
have closely resembled the contests of the Spartan
epheboi in the shady playing-fields. The life of the
boys was surrounded with a military atmosphere
throughout. They wore military dress and counted
their weapons their most valuable possessions. Young
Cretans remained in the packs till after marriage.
Then they returned to their homes and the clubs.</p>

<p>Of the practical results of Cretan education nothing
can be said. From the day when Idomeneus sets sail
from Troy, Crete almost disappears from Hellenic
history. Too strong to be attacked by their neighbours,
too much weakened by intestine feuds to assume the
aggressive, the Cretans remained aloof from their
compatriots on the mainland and in the archipelago
till the close of the period of Hellenic independence.

only to children. “Each man is given a portion to himself,
which he does not share with any one. They have as much
barley bread as they like, and there is an earthenware cup of
wine standing by each man, for him to put his lips to when he
feels disposed. The chief dish is always the same for all,
boiled pork. There is plenty of Spartan broth, and some olives,
cheese, and figs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Each contributes to his mess about 18 gallons of barley
meal, 60 or 70 pints of wine, and a small quantity of figs and
cheese, and 10 Aeginetan obols for extras.” This contribution
no doubt covered expenses, for the quantity sent by an absentee
king, probably representing the average consumption of an
individual, falls well within this estimate (<abbr title="compare Herodotos six">cf. Herod. <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> </abbr> 57).
After the regular meal<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
an <ins title="epaiklon">ἔπαικλον</ins> or extra meal might be
served. It would be provided by a member of the mess,
consisting either of the results of hunting or the produce
of his farm, for nothing might be bought. The ordinary
components of such a meal were pigeons, geese, fieldfares,
blackbirds, hares, lambs, and kids, and wheaten bread, a
welcome change from the usual barley loaves. The cooks
proclaimed the name of the giver, so that he might get the
credit. <ins title="epaikla">ἔπαικλα</ins> were often exacted as fines for offences from
rich members; the poor had to pay laurel leaves or reeds.
There was also a special sort of <ins title="epaiklon">ἔπαικλον</ins> designed for the
children, barley meal soaked in olive oil&mdash;a sort of porridge, in
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
fact. According to Nicocles the Laconian, this was swallowed
in laurel leaves&mdash;which does not sound very inviting.</p>

<p>There were also banquets independent of the messes.
These were called <ins title="kopides">κοπίδες</ins>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span>
Tents were set up in the sacred
enclosure round the temple of the deity in whose honour the
feast was given. Heaps of brushwood covered with carpets
served for couches. The food consisted of slices of meat,
round buns, cheese, slices of sausage, and for dessert dried figs
and various beans.</p>

<p>At the Tithenidia, or Nurses’ Feast, a <ins title="kopis">κοπίς</ins> was given at
the temple of Artemis Koruthalia by the stream Tiassos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
The
nurses brought the boy-babies to it. The sacrifice was a
sucking pig, and baked loaves were served. The <ins title="kopides">κοπίδες</ins> were
evidently a feature of Spartan life: Epilukos makes his “laddie”
(<ins title="kôraliskos">κωράλισκος</ins>) remark, “I will go to the <ins title="kopis">κοπίς</ins> in Amuklai at
Appellas’ house, where will be buns and loaves and jolly good
broth”: which shows that the children’s parties at Sparta were
regarded as attractive.</p>

<p>The Karneia, the great Spartan festival, was an imitation
of camp-life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span>
The sacrificial meal was served in tents, each
containing nine men, and everything was done to the word of
command.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> chief authorities for the attendance at these meals are the
two historians, Dosiades and Purgion, quoted in Athenaeus (143).
Dosiades states that an equal portion is set before each man
present, but to the younger members is given a half portion of
meat, and they do not touch any of the other things. Purgion
says: “To the sons, who sit on lower seats by their fathers’
chairs, they give a half portion of what is supplied to the
men; orphans receive a full share.” The comparison of the
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
two passages shows that the “younger members” mentioned
by Dosiades are what Purgion calls the orphans, and that
they are not yet full-grown men. Thus they must be either
the boys or the epheboi. It is not, however, at all likely
that the epheboi, who were of military age and engaged in
violent exercises, would be given only half rations, so these
younger members are the boys not yet included in the <ins title="agelai">ἀγέλαι</ins>.
Dosiades continues: “On each table is set a drinking vessel,
of weak wine. This all who sit at the common table share
equally. The children have a bowl to themselves,” that is,
the boys who sat beside their fathers but not at the table.
“After supper first they discuss the political situation, and
then recall feats in battle, and praise those who have distinguished
themselves, encouraging the youngers to heroism.”
The quotation shows that not merely the small children are
in question, but boys of an age to understand politics and war.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">ATHENS AND THE REST OF HELLAS:<br />
GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Laconia</span> and Crete were mainly agricultural countries
that had little concern with trade or manufactures.
Their citizens comprised a landed aristocracy, supported
by estates which were cultivated for them by a subject
population; there was no necessity, therefore, for them
to prepare their boys for any profession or trade, or
even to instruct them in the principles of agriculture.
The young Spartan or Cretan no more needed professional
or technical instruction of any sort than the richer
absentee Irish landlords of the present day. He could
give the whole of his school-time, without any sacrifice
of his financial prospects, to the training of his body
and of his character.</p>

<p>But the rest of Hellas was for the most part the
scene of busy manufactures and extensive trade. It
would be natural to expect that great commercial
peoples, like the Athenians or the Ionians of Asia
Minor, would have set great store by the commercial
elements of education, and to assume that business
methods and utilitarian branches of study would have
occupied a large place in their schools. But this was
very far from being the case. To a Hellene education
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
meant the training of character and taste, and the
symmetrical development of body, mind, and imagination.
He would not have included under so honourable
a name either any course of instruction in which the
pupils mastered their future trade or profession, or any
accumulation of knowledge undertaken with the object
of making money. Consequently technical training of
all sorts was excluded from Hellenic schools and passed
over in silence by Hellenic educationalists. Information
concerning it must be pieced together from stray facts
and casual allusions, and the whole idea of “utilitarian”
instruction, in the modern sense of the word, must be
carefully put aside during any consideration of Hellenic
schools.</p>

<p>For the Hellenes as a nation regarded all forms of
handicraft as <em>bourgeois</em> (<ins title="banausos">βάναυσος</ins>) and contemptible.
Herodotos says that they derived this view from the
surrounding peoples, who all held it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
To do anything
in order to extract money from some one else
was, in their opinion, vulgar and ungentlemanly. The
lyric poets and the Sophists were alike blamed for taking
fees. The cheapness and abundance of serf- or slave-labour
made it possible for a large proportion of the
free population to live in idleness, and devote their time
to the development of the body by physical exercises,
of the mind by perpetual discussions, and of the
imagination by art and music. Citizenship required
leisure, in the days before representative government
came into vogue. It was owing to this principle that
the Athenian received pay for a day’s attendance in the
Law Courts or the Assembly, for by this means the
poorest citizen obtained an artificial leisure for the performance
of his duties. Otherwise true citizenship was
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
impossible. Plato regards a tradesman as unfit to be an
acting citizen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span>
Aristotle rejects as unworthy of a free
man all trades which interfere with bodily development
or take time which ought to be devoted to mental improvement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span>
Xenophon explains the reason of this
attitude. The discredit which attaches to the <em>bourgeois</em>
occupations is quite natural; for they ruin the physical
condition of those who practise them, compelling them
to sit down and live in the shade, and in some cases to
spend their day by the fire. The body thus becomes
effeminate, and the character is weakened at the same
time. Tradesmen, too, have less leisure for serving
their friends and the State. In some communities,
especially the most warlike, the citizens are not allowed
to practise sedentary trades.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
The owner of a factory
or a farm worked by slave-labour was exempt from
corrupting influences: it was only actual work which
was degrading.</p>

<p>A large number, however, from among the poorer
classes were compelled to work with their own hands;
so these, as well as the slaves, required technical instruction.
Some indications survive as to the manner in
which this was imparted. Trades were mostly hereditary;
“the sons of the craftsmen learn their fathers’
trade, so far as their fathers and their friends of the
same trade can teach it.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span>
But others might also learn.
Xenophon mentions such cases. “When you apprentice
a boy to a trade,” he says, “you draw up a statement
of what you mean him to be taught,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span>
and the fees were
not paid unless this agreement was carried out. The
<cite>Kleitophon</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span>
mentions as the two functions of the
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
builder or the doctor the practising of their profession
and the teaching of pupils. The <cite>Republic</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
says: “If
owing to poverty a craftsman is unable to provide the
books and other requisites of his calling, his work will
suffer, and his sons and any others whom he may be
teaching will not learn their trade so well.” The
teaching of building is mentioned in the <cite>Gorgias</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>
In the <cite>Republic</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span>
Plato states that the <ins title="paides">παῖδες</ins> of the
potters&mdash;a word which will include both sons and
apprentices&mdash;act as servants and look on for a long time
before they are allowed to try their hands themselves at
making pots. “To learn pot-making on a wine-jar”
was a proverb for beginning with the most difficult part
of a subject. The pupils of a doctor named Pittalos are
mentioned in the <cite>Acharnians</cite> of Aristophanes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
The
comic poets of the early third century contain several
references to cookery-schools. Sosipater makes one
cook say that his pupils must learn astrology, architecture,
and strategy before they come to him, just as Plato
had exacted a preliminary knowledge of mathematics
from his disciples. Euphron gives ten months as the
minimum length of a course of cookery. Aristotle
mentions a man at Syracuse who taught slaves how to
wait at table, and perform their household duties: perhaps
the play of Pherekrates<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span>
entitled <cite>The Slave-Teacher</cite>
may have dealt with a similar case. From
these fragments a picture can be drawn of a regular
system of apprenticeship by which the knowledge of the
trades was handed down. Solon, wishing to encourage
Athenian manufactures, had enacted that if a father
did not have his son taught some trade, he could not
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
legally demand to be supported in his old age.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span>
But
the general opinion of Hellas still maintained that
“technical instruction and all teaching which aimed only
at money-making was vulgar and did not deserve the
name of education. True education aimed solely at
virtue, making the child yearn to be a good citizen,
skilled to rule and to obey.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span>
For all the gold on the
earth and under it, according to Plato, could not pay
the price of virtue, or deserve to be given in exchange
for a man’s soul. Thus the Spartans and Cretans did
not stand alone, but had the support of all Hellas, in
banishing from their schools any idea of technical or
professional instruction.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>But in one notable point their idea of education
differed from that which was prevalent in most of the
Hellenic States. The regular course of education in
Athens and in most Hellenic States was for boys alone:
no girls need apply. The women lived in almost
Oriental seclusion;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span>
the duty of an Athenian mother
was, according to Perikles,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span>
to live so retired a life
that her name should never be mentioned among
the men either for praise or blame. Listen to the
description which an Athenian country gentleman
gives of his wife.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>
 “What was she likely to know
when I married her? Why, she was not yet fifteen
when I introduced her to my house, and she had
been brought up always under the strictest supervision;
as far as could be managed, she had not been
allowed to see anything, hear anything, or ask any
questions. Don’t you think that it was all that could
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
be expected of her, if she knew how to take raw wool
and make it into a cloak, and had seen how wool-work
is served out to handmaidens?” Sokrates, however, to
whom this question is addressed, seems to think that
she might have learnt “from her father and mother the
duties which would belong to her in after life.” These,
however, in this case her husband had to teach her.
He explains to her that she must see that everything
has a place to itself and is always put there; she must
also give out the stores, teach the slaves their duties and
nurse them when they are ill, and tend the young
children. The summary of the explanation is that
Heaven has appointed a fair division of labour between
husband and wife: the wife manages everything indoors
and the husband everything out of doors. A stay-at-home
husband or a gad-about wife equally offend
against respectability. As a rule, apparently, the
women simply sat in the house, “like slaves,” as it
seemed to the ordinary athletic Hellene. Xenophon’s
model husband suggests that his wife should take exercise
by walking about the house to see how the supplies
were given out, to inspect the arrangements of the
cupboards, and to watch the washing and the wringing-out
of the clothes: this exercise will give her health and
an appetite. But Xenophon was an admirer of Spartan
customs and the athletic Spartan women: probably
these ideas would not have occurred to the ordinary
Athenian husband.</p>

<p>Another picture may be quoted from Hellenic
literature to show the extent of education which an
ordinary woman received.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span>
A certain Aristarchos
comes to Sokrates in great distress. A number of
female relatives, quite destitute, have been thrown upon
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
his hands owing to various circumstances, and he must
support them; but he has not the requisite means.
Sokrates naturally suggests that he should make them
work for their living. But they do not know how to,
says Aristarchos. However, by dint of questioning,
Sokrates elicits the fact that they can make men’s and
women’s garments, and also pastry and bread. These,
then, were apparently the accomplishments which an
ordinary girl in Hellas, brought up without any idea of
having to earn her own living, would acquire. Plato
also mentions weaving and cooking as the provinces in
which women excel,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
and describes the women of Attika
as “living indoors, managing the household and superintending
the loom and wool-work generally.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Thus the Athenian girl spent her time indoors,
learning to be a regular “Hausfrau,” skilled in weaving,
cooking, and household management. She had her
special maid to wait on her,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span>
as her brothers had their
paidagogos. She would, as a rule, be married young,
and would naturally be very shy after such an upbringing;
the marriage was arranged between the
bridegroom and the parents, and, owing to the seclusion
of the women at Athens, love-matches were well-nigh
impossible. The match was mainly a question of the
dowry. Xenophon<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span>
gives a vivid picture of one of
these girl-wives gradually “growing accustomed to her
husband and becoming sufficiently tame to hold conversation
with him.” To keep their beauty under such
conditions they employed rouge and white, and high-heeled
shoes. Such mothers would be quite incapable
of giving any literary or musical education to their
children; hence the boys went away to school as soon
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
as possible. Their school-life usually began when they
were about six years old, the exact age being left to the
parents’ choice.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span>
Before this, they learnt in the nursery
the various current fables and ballads, and the national
mythology.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
 “As soon as the child understands what
is said, the nurse and the mother and the paidogogos,
yes, and the father himself, strive with one another in
improving its character, in every word and deed showing
it what is just and what is unjust, what is beautiful and
what is ugly, what is holy and what is unholy. It is
always ‘Do this’ and ‘Don’t do that.’ If a child is
disobedient, it is corrected with threats and blows.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
Besides this purely moral training there might, no
doubt, be a certain amount of technical or of literary
instruction at home,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span>
and bits of poetry might be learnt.
Up to this age boys and girls lived together.</p>

<p>The sons of rich parents apparently went to school
earliest: their poorer fellow-citizens went later.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
This
was natural. The poor could not keep their sons at
school for a long time, for they wanted their services in
the shop or on the farm, and the fees were a burden:
so they did not send them till they were old enough to
pick up instruction quickly. The rich, on the other
hand, to whom money was no object, sent their boys to
school at an early age, when they could do little more
than look on, while their elders worked. Aristotle
commends this custom, and imposes two years of such
“playing at school” upon the boys of his ideal State.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
The ordinary system of primary education at Athens
consisted of three parts, presided over respectively by
the “grammatistes,” “kitharistes,” and “paidotribes.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span>
The grammatistes taught reading, writing, and some
arithmetic, and made his pupils read and learn by heart
the great poets, Homer and Hesiod and others. The
kitharistes taught the boys how to play the seven-stringed
lyre and sing to it the works of the lyric
poets, which they would incidentally have to learn.
The paidotribes presided over their physical development
in a scientific way; he taught them wrestling,
boxing, the pankration, running, jumping, throwing the
diskos and javelin, and various other exercises; his
school-room was the palaistra. To this triple system
some boys added drawing and painting;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span>
but this
subject seems to have been an extra till late in the
fourth century. Literature, music, and athletics composed
the ordinary course at Athens.</p>

<p>Which of the three branches of education began
first? Probably they were all taught simultaneously.
The order in which they are usually mentioned does
not point to a fixed sequence. Letters were naturally
mentioned first, because all citizens alike learned this
subject. Gymnastics were put last, because, owing to
the public gymnasia, these exercises were carried on
long after the other schooling had ceased. Moreover,
most of the recognised exercises of the palaistra were
not taught to small boys; from the nature of the
exercises and from the pictures on the vases it may be
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
deduced that the average boy did not learn them till
his twelfth year at the earliest. But physical training
of an easier sort of course commenced much earlier,
and boys seem to have attended a palaistra from their
sixth year onwards to receive it. Both Plato and
Aristotle demand that it should begin several years
before any intellectual instruction; and Plato, making
athletics such as shooting and riding begin at six, defers
letters till ten and lyre-playing till thirteen. Gymnastics
would naturally occupy a part of the day for a
healthy young Hellene during the whole time from
his sixth year till manhood. It is thus that the
<cite>Charmides</cite> mentions “quite tiny boys” as present in
the palaistra, as well as older lads and young men.</p>

<p>Lyre-playing may have been deferred, as a harder
subject, till the boy had learned letters for several
years; but the seven-stringed lyre, with the simple
old Hellenic music, was probably not a very difficult
instrument to master. The chief factor which determined
the arrangement of subjects in an ordinary
family was no doubt the paidagogos. If there was
only one son, he could go to whatever school his
parents pleased; but if there were several, elders and
youngers had all to go to the same school at the same
time, for there was only one paidagogos to a whole
family as a rule, and he could never allow any of his
charges to go out of his sight.</p>

<p>That the three subjects were usually taught simultaneously
may be inferred from a passage of Xenophon.
“In every part of Hellas except Sparta,” he says, “those
who claim to give their sons the best education, as soon
as ever the child understands what is said to him, at
once make one of their servants his paidagogos, and at
once send him off to school to learn letters and music
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
and the exercises of the Palaistra.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
The emphasis
upon the word “at once” certainly implies that the
three subjects began simultaneously.</p>

<p>On the vases letters and music are seen being taught
side by side in the same school; this was a convenient
and natural arrangement. Writing-tablets and rulers
are also seen suspended on the walls of music-schools
and palaistrai, and lyres on the walls of letter-schools<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>;
which suggests that the boys went from one building to
another in the day, taking their property with them.
Plato states that three years apiece was a reasonable time
for learning letters and the lyre.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>
The eight years
between six and fourteen, the ordinary time devoted at
Athens in the fourth century to the primary triple
course, would give space for these six years, with two
years to spare for elaboration. Gymnastics are meant
to go on during the whole period in Plato, and so do
not require a special allowance of time to themselves.</p>

<p>This system of primary education at Athens may
reasonably be traced back to the beginning of the sixth
century. Solon is credited with a regulation which
made letters compulsory, and with certain moral enactments
dealing with existing schools and palaistrai.
The much-disputed popularisation of Homer at Athens
by Peisistratos was probably connected with the growth
of the Schools of Letters. Of the existence of music-schools
at this date there is evidence from a sixth-century
vase in the British Museum,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
which represents
a youth amusing himself with a dog, behind a seated
man who is playing a lyre. This might not seem very
conclusive in itself; but now compare it with the two
“amphorai” of the fifth century,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
which undoubtedly
<!--Blank Page-->
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
represent scenes in a music-school. The situation is
almost identical; each alike shows the boy playing with
the animal behind his master’s chair. Curiously enough,
all three vases come from Kameiros in Rhodes, although
they are of Athenian manufacture. Thus the music-school
may also be traced back well into the sixth
century, in company with the school of letters and the
palaistra; and the antiquity of the system of Primary
Education is thus established.</p>

<p>In earlier days this primary course had no doubt
sometimes lasted till the boy was eighteen: but towards
the end of the fifth century a secondary stage of education
arose, occupying the years immediately preceding
eighteen. This secondary stage is recognised in the
pseudo-Platonic <cite>Axiochos</cite> and in the fragment of
Teles quoted by Stobaeus. More important evidence
is supplied by Plato. In the <cite>Republic</cite> he assigns
an elaborate system of mathematics to the age just
before <ins title="ephêbeia">ἐφηβεία</ins>, which he sets at seventeen or eighteen,
the natural age varying with the individual, while the
legal age remained fixed.</p>

<p>When did this Secondary Education begin? Aristotle,
counting back from <ins title="ephêbeia">ἐφηβεία</ins>, assigns three years to it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span>
He has just commended the arrangement of education,
not on hard and fast lines, but in accordance with the
natural growth of the individual: so he must mean his
<ins title="ephêbeia">ἐφηβεία</ins> to vary from seventeen to eighteen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span>
Thus he
puts the beginning of secondary education at fourteen
or fifteen, the average age of <ins title="hêbê">ἥβη</ins> in Hellas, as in Rome.
From <ins title="hêbê">ἥβη</ins> till twenty-one the young Athenian was a
<ins title="meirakion">μειράκιον</ins>. Thus in point of age the <ins title="pais">παῖς</ins> of the
primary schools corresponds to the Roman “impubes,”
and the <ins title="meirakion">μειράκιον</ins> to the “adolescens”; but <ins title="meirakion">μειράκιον</ins>
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
and <ins title="pais">παῖς</ins> are used very loosely, and the former word is
often replaced by <ins title="neaniskos">νεανίσκος</ins>. We shall, as a rule, call
the pupils of the primary schools boys, and those of the
secondary lads.</p>

<p>Fourteen did not, however, represent an exact point
at which it was compulsory to leave the primary school.
Sons of the poor left earlier; rich or unoccupied
Athenians might remain later: Sokrates even attended
a lyre-school among the boys when he was middle-aged.
The primary schoolmasters started advanced
classes in astronomy and mathematics to suit elder
pupils.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span>
In the palaistrai there were separate classes
of boys and lads, who were only supposed to meet on
feast-days;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span>
in the <cite>Charmides</cite>, however, grown men,
lads, boys, and quite tiny boys are all exercising
together.</p>

<p>Many lads, especially in earlier times, did not attend
the schools at all, but gave their time to gymnastics and
whatever else they pleased.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_137" id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span>
Xenophon relates this as
one of the demerits of the Athenian system.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The mental attainments of a lad who is apparently
but little over fourteen are sketched in Plato’s <cite>Lusis</cite>.
The lad Lusis knows how to read and write, and how
to string and play the lyre. He recognises a quotation
from Homer, and has even come across the “prose
treatises of the very wise, who say that like must
always be friendly to like; these are the men who
reason and write about the Universe and Nature.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This secondary education, beginning soon after
fourteen, was only for the rich: the poor could not
afford to keep their sons away from the farm or trade
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
any longer. It might be scattered over the whole of
the next six or seven years; but there was a serious
interruption, which usually terminated it. At eighteen
the young Athenian became in the eye of the law an
ephebos and was called out to undergo two years of
military training. During this period of conscription
it was no doubt possible, especially in the laxer days of
the fourth century, to do some intellectual work; but
Plato is probably only accepting the usual custom when
he frees the epheboi of his State from all mental studies
and makes them give their whole energies to military
and gymnastic training. And when the ephebos returned
to civil life, he was a full citizen and was hardly
likely to return to school; he might attend an occasional
lecture or so, but that was all.</p>

<p>Thus secondary education usually occupied the years
between fourteen and eighteen, although the latter limit
was in no way definitely fixed, and the same subjects
might be studied at any age. In earlier days no doubt
lads spent their time in continuing their musical
studies: primary education could be conducted in a
more leisurely fashion when there was still little to
be learnt, and the lyre may have been deferred till
this age, as Plato in similar circumstances defers
it in the <cite>Laws</cite>. But in the days of Perikles knowledge
began to increase and boys had more to learn.
So the lyre was crowded into the first period of education,
and a new series of secondary subjects arose. It
was these years which were usually devoted to the four
years’ course which was customary in the school of
Isokrates. Before this date the time was, as a rule,
spent in attending the lectures of the wandering
Sophists or in picking up a smattering of philosophy.
Among the subjects which thus formed a part of
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
secondary education were mathematics of various
kinds, more advanced literary criticism, a certain
amount of natural history and science, a knowledge of
the laws and constitution of Athens, a small quantity
of philosophy, ethical, political, and metaphysical, and
above all, rhetoric. Plato in his <cite>Republic</cite>, developing
this Athenian system of secondary education, assigns
to the years immediately preceding eighteen the theory
of numbers, geometry, plane and solid, kinetics and
harmonics, and expressly excludes dialectic as more
suitable to a later age;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span>
in the <cite>Laws</cite>, prescribing
for the whole population, not for a few selected intellects,
he orders practical arithmetic, geometry, and
enough astronomy to make the calendar intelligible.
The pseudo-Platonic <cite>Axiochos</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span>
ascribes to Prodikos
the statement that “when a child grows older, he
endures the tyranny of mathematicians, teachers of
tactics, and ‘critics.’” These last are the professors
of that curious criticism of poetry which is found, for
instance, in the <cite>Protagoras</cite> as a subject of the lectures
of that Sophist as well as of Hippias.</p>

<p>At eighteen the young Athenian partially came of
age. He then had to submit to a two years’ course of
military training, of which the first year was spent in
Athens and the second in the frontier forts and in
camp. During this period he probably had little time
for intellectual occupations. But when the military
power of Athens collapsed under the Macedonian
dominion, the military duties of the epheboi became
voluntary, and their training was replaced by regular
courses of philosophy and literature. The military
system became a University, attended by a few young
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
men of wealth and position and a good many foreigners.
As the forerunner of the first University, the two
years’ training of the epheboi may fitly receive the
name of Tertiary Education, in spite of the fact that till
the third century it involved only military instruction.</p>

<p>Thus we have Athenian education divided into
three stages: Primary from six to fourteen, Secondary
from fourteen to eighteen, and Tertiary from eighteen
to twenty; while gymnastic training extended over the
whole period.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Of these three stages the third alone was compulsory
and provided by the State. The second was entirely
voluntary, and only the richest and most leisured boys
applied themselves to it. Gymnastics of some sort
were rendered almost obligatory by the liability of every
citizen to military and naval service at a moment’s
notice; but they needed little encouragement. Of the
primary subjects, letters were probably compulsory by
law, and music was almost invariably taught. An old
law, ascribed to Solon,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>
enacted that every boy should
learn swimming and his letters; after which, the poorer
might turn their attention to trade or farming, while
the richer passed on to learn music, riding, gymnastics,
hunting, and philosophy. In the <cite>Kriton</cite> of Plato the
personified Laws of Athens, recounting to Sokrates the
many services which they had done him, mention that
they had “charged his father to educate him in Music
and Letters.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
But the Laws in Hellas include the
customs, as well as the constitution, of a State. It was
certainly customary for nearly every citizen at Athens to
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
learn some music; but it was not compulsory. We
meet no Athenian in literature who is ignorant of his
letters; we meet several who know no music. In
Aristophanes, Demosthenes and Nikias are on the lookout
for the most vulgar and low-class man in Athens,
in order that he may oust Kleon from popular favour,
by outdoing him in vulgarity. They find a sausage-seller.
But even this man knows his letters, though
not very well.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>
Of music, however, he is ignorant,
and he has never attended the lessons of a paidotribes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
though Kleon seems to expect him to have done so.
Kleon, who is represented as an utter boor, is yet said
to have attended a lyre-school.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
In the <cite>Theages</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span>
literature and lyre-playing and athletics are mentioned
as the ordinary education of a gentleman. In fiercely
democratic Athens every parent was eager to bring up
his sons as gentlemen, and no doubt sent them through
the whole course if he could possibly afford it. But the
State attitude towards education, as distinct from the
voluntary customs of the citizens, may be summarised
in the words of Sokrates to Alkibiades: “No one, so
to speak, cares a straw how you or any other Athenian
is brought up.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The schoolmasters opened their schools as private
enterprises, fixing for themselves the fees and the subjects
taught. The parents chose what they thought
a suitable school, according to their means and the
subjects which they wished their sons to learn. Thus
Sokrates says to his eldest son, Lamprokles,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span>
 “When
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
boys seem old enough to learn anything, their parents
teach them whatever they themselves know that is
likely to be useful to them; subjects which they think
others better qualified to teach they send them to
school to learn, spending money upon this object.”
This suggests that the poor may frequently have passed
on their own knowledge of letters to their sons without
the expense of a school. But all this was a private
transaction between parent and teacher. The State
interfered with the matter only so far as to impose
certain moral regulations on the schools and the
gymnasia, to fix the hours of opening and closing, and
so forth, and to suggest that every boy should be
taught his letters.</p>

<p>The teaching of the elementary stages of Letters,
that is, the three R’s, was, as will be shown later on,
cheaply obtained, and was within the reach of the
poorest. Music and athletics would naturally be more
expensive, for they required much greater study and
talents upon the part of their teachers. The State
did take some steps to make these branches of education
cheaper, and so throw them open to a larger number.</p>

<p>Gymnasia and palaistrai were built at public expense,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>
that any one might go and exercise himself without
charge. These buildings were also open to spectators,
so that any one could acquire at any rate a rudimentary
knowledge of boxing, wrestling, and the other branches
of athletics, by watching his more proficient fellow-citizens
practising them. The epheboi received instruction
in athletic exercises at the cost of the State. But
the children, so far as they received physical training
in schools, must have received it in private palaistrai;
their lessons are described as taking place “in the
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
house of the paidotribes,” <ins title="en paidotribou">ἐν παιδοτρίβου</ins>&mdash;an idiom
which always implies ownership or special rights; and
the majority of palaistrai were private buildings, called
by their owners’ names. Thus we hear of the palaistrai
of Siburtios, of Taureas,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span>
and so forth: Siburtios and
Taureas were no doubt the paidotribai who taught
there. In a later age, when the boys of different
palaistrai ran torch races against one another, the
palaistra of Timeas is victorious on two occasions, that
of Antigenes once.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
</p>

<p>By the system of leitourgiai rich citizens were made
chargeable for the expenses of the epheboi of their tribe
who were training for the torch races. These races
seem to have been the only branch of athletics which
was thus endowed; however, they were numerous, even
in the smaller country districts, so that many epheboi
must have profited by this free training.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span>
 “Leitourgiai”
also provided free instruction in chorus-dancing (which
included singing as well as dancing) for such boys as
were selected for competition. The rich “choregos”
appointed for the year had to produce a chorus of boys
belonging to his tribe for some festival, paying all the
expenses of teaching and training them himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span>
It
is to this free school that the Solonic law refers when
it mentions the “joint attendance of the boys and the
dithyrambic choruses”; for it goes on to state that
the ordinance with regard to this matter was that the
“choregos” should be over forty.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span>
In Demosthenes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
a certain Mantitheos, who had not been acknowledged
by his father at the usual time, “attended school among
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
the boys of the Hippothontid tribe to learn chorus-dancing”:
had he been acknowledged, he would have
gone to the Acamantid, his father’s tribe. No doubt,
if the choregos was keen about gaining a victory, he
would give a trial to more than the fifty boys required
for a dithyrambic contest. In any case, provided that
all the tribes competed, this one contest (and there
were several in the course of a year) gave a free
education to 500 boys. Xenophon notices that it
was the “demos,” the poor majority, who mainly got
the advantage of free training under gumnasiarchoi
and choregoi:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span>
the rich naturally preferred to send
their boys to more select schools.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Thus the more elementary stages of letters alone
were compulsory at Athens, but music and gymnastics
were almost universally taught, and the cost of instruction
in these subjects was reduced in various ways by
State action: the greater part might be learned for
nothing. But parents needed little compulsion or
encouragement to get their children taught. So much
did the Hellenes regard education as a necessity for
their boys, that when the Athenians were driven from
their homes by Xerxes, and their women and children
crossed over to Troizen, the hospitable Troizenians
provided their guests with schoolmasters, so that not
even in such a crisis might the boys be forced to take
a holiday.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>
And when Mitulene wished to punish her
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
revolted allies in the most severe way possible, she
prevented them from teaching their children letters
and music.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Of State action with regard to education in Hellas
elsewhere than in Sparta, Crete, and Athens, little is
known. But the Chalcidian cities in Sicily and Italy
are said to have provided literary education at public
expense and under public supervision.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
The law enacting
this is ascribed to the great lawgiver, Charondas,
and, although he is a somewhat shadowy figure,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span>
there
must have been some foundation for the story, at
any rate at a later date. During the Macedonian
period kings and other rich men often bequeathed large
sums of money to their favourite cities, in order to
endow the educational system. We hear of this
happening in Teos and at Delphi: in these places
the parents, if they paid any fees at all, cannot have
paid much. But there is no authority for any such
endowments during the period which we are considering.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>But if education was neither enforced nor assisted
to any considerable degree by the State, it was certainly
encouraged by the prizes which were offered. Every
city, and probably most villages, had local competitions
annually, and in many cases more frequently
still, in which some of the “events” were reserved for
citizens, while others were open to all comers. There
were separate prizes for different ages; the ordinary
division was into boys and grown men, an intermediate
class of “the beardless” being sometimes added. But
in some Attic inscriptions the boys are divided into
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
three groups, and in Chios the epheboi were so
distributed.</p>

<p>These competitions were no doubt largely athletic.
But music was usually provided for as well, and in
many places there were literary competitions also. At
Athens the different <ins title="phratriai">φρατρίαι</ins> seem to have offered
prizes annually on the Koureotis day of the Apatouria
to the boys who recited best, the piece for recitation
being chosen by each competitor. Kritias took part in
the competition when ten years old.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span>

the subjects might be.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>How far individual schoolmasters, as distinct from
the State, gave prizes to their pupils, is little known;
an epigram in the <cite>Anthology</cite> supplies the only evidence,
by narrating that “Konnaros received eighty knucklebones
because he wrote beautifully, better than the
other boys.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_171" id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>
But probably as a general rule the task
of rewarding merit was left to the public contests.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Thus the State did much to encourage, if it did
little to assist or enforce, education. With such
splendid rewards before them, boys were probably
quite eager to attend school, or at any rate the palaistra.
As soon as they were old enough to go to school,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span>
they
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
were entrusted to an elderly slave,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span>
who had to follow
his master’s boys about wherever they went and never
let them go out of his sight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
This was the paidagogos&mdash;a
mixture of nurse, footman, chaperon, and tutor&mdash;who
is so prominent a figure on the vases and in the
literature of classical Hellas. There was only one for
the family, so that all the boys had to go about together
and to attend the same schools and the same palaistrai
at the same time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span>
He waited on them in the house,
carried their books or lyres to school, sat and watched
them in the schoolroom, and kept a strict eye upon
their manners and morality in the streets and the
gymnasia. Thus, for instance, in Plato, Lusis and
Menexenos have their paidagogoi in attendance at the
palaistra, who come and force them away from the
absorbing conversation of Sokrates, when it is time for
them to go home.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span>
On a vase these attendants may
be seen sitting on stools behind their charges, in the
schools of letters and music, with long and suggestive
canes in their hands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>
A careful parent would, of
course, see that a slave who was to occupy so responsible
a position was worthy of it: but great carelessness
seems often to have been shown in this matter. The
paidagogoi of Lusis and Menexenos, boys of rank and
position, had a bad accent, and on a festival day, it is
true, were slightly intoxicated.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
Plutarch notices that
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
in his time parents often selected for this office slaves
who were of no use for any other purpose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span>
Xenophon,
feeling the demerits of the Athenian custom, commends
the Spartans, who entrust the boys not to slaves, but
to public officials of the highest rank.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_180" id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span>
But in well-regulated
households the paidagogos was often a most
worthy and valuable servant. Sikinnos, who attended
the children of Themistokles in this capacity, was
entrusted by his master with the famous message to
Xerxes, which brought on the battle of Salamis; he
was afterwards rewarded with his freedom, the citizenship
of Thespiai, and a substantial sum of money.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span>
The custom of employing these male-nurses dated back
to early times at Athens: for Solon made regulations
about them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Boys were entrusted to paidagogoi as soon as they
went to school at six. This tutelage might last till
the boy was eighteen<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>
and came of age; but more
frequently it stopped earlier. Xenophon,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_184" id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span>
in his wish
to disparage everything not Spartan, declares that in
all other States the boys were set free from paidagogoi
and schoolmasters as soon as they became <ins title="meirakia">μειράκια</ins>,
<span class="decoration">i.e.</span> at about fourteen or fifteen. The conjunction of
schoolmasters suggests the explanation of the variations
in age. When an elder brother ceased to attend
school, and his younger brothers were still pursuing
their studies, there being only one paidagogos, he had
to be left unattended. But in cases where there was
only one son, or where the eldest of several stayed on
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
at school until he came of age, he would have the
paidagogos to attend him until he was his own master.</p>

<p>The life of such an attendant must have been an
anxious one in many cases. Plato compares his relations
towards his charges with the relations of an
invalid towards his health: “He has to follow the
disease wherever it leads, being unable to cure it, and
he spends his life in perpetual anxiety with no time for
anything else.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span>
With unruly boys of different ages,
and consequently of different tastes and desires, the
slave must have been often in a difficult position.
He had, however, the right of inflicting corporal
punishment.</p>

<p>The chief object of the paidagogos was to safeguard
the morals of his charges. Boys were expected to be
as modest and quiet in their whole behaviour, and as
carefully chaperoned, as young girls. Parents told
the schoolmasters to bestow much more attention upon
the boy’s behaviour than upon his letters and music.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span>
This attitude was characteristic of Athens from
the first. The school laws of Solon, as quoted by
Aischines, deal wholly with morality. He gives the
following account of them<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The old lawgivers stated expressly what sort of
life the free boy ought to lead and how he ought to
be brought up; they also dealt with the manners of
lads and men of other ages.” “In the case of the
schoolmasters, to whom we are compelled to entrust
our children, although their livelihood depends upon
their good character, and bad behaviour is ruinous to
them, yet the lawgiver obviously distrusts them. For
he expressly states, first, the hour at which the free
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
boy ought to go to school; secondly, how many other
boys are to be present in the school; and then at what
hour he is to leave. He forbids the schoolmasters to
open their schools and the paidotribai their palaistrai
before sunrise, and orders them to close before sunset,
being very suspicious of the empty streets and of the
darkness. Then he dealt with the boys who attended
schools, as to who they should be and of what ages;
and with the official who is to oversee these matters.
He dealt too with the regulation of the paidagogoi, and
with the festival of the Muses in the schools and of
Hermes in the palaistrai. Finally, he laid down
regulations about the joint attendance of the boys and
the round of dithyrambic dances; for he directed that
the Choregos should be over forty.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“No one over the age of boyhood might enter
while the boys were in school, except the son, brother,
or son-in-law of the master: the penalty of infringing
this regulation was death. At the festival of Hermes
the person in charge of the gymnasium<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span>
was not to
allow any one over age to accompany the boys in any
way: unless he excluded such persons from the
gymnasium, he was to come under the law of corrupting
free boys.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that these regulations are entirely
concerned with morality: they safeguard an existing
system. They prescribe neither the methods nor the
subjects of education; for with such matters the
Athenian government did not interfere. But over
the question of morals it becomes unexpectedly
tyrannous, and makes the most minute regulations
worthy of the strictest bureaucracy. It interfered on
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
this point in other ways also. The solemn council on
the Areiopagos had a special supervision over the
young, from Solon’s time onward; this was partially
taken away from it by Ephialtes and Perikles, but
the <cite>Axiochos</cite> shows that, though in abeyance, it continued
to exist; in the middle of the fourth century,
however, Isokrates laments that it had fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>The <cite>Axiochos</cite> also states that the ten Sophronistai,
elected to guard the morals of the epheboi, exercised
control over lads also. These officials probably took
their rise in the days of Solon: the regulation that
they must be over forty harmonises with the other
enactments of those days; and, although they died out
at the end of the fourth century, they were revived under
the Roman Empire. Now it is most unlikely that
the archaistic legislators of imperial times would have
revived an office which had only existed during the
closing decades of the fourth century. Solon is known
to have appointed a magistracy specially to deal with
the children;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
and, if these magistrates were not the
Sophronistai, all trace of his creation has been lost,
which is most unlikely to have happened. So the
Sophronistai probably date from early times. Their
duty was a general supervision of the morals of the
young; their chief function would be to prosecute,
on behalf of the State, parents and schoolmasters
who infringed Solon’s moral regulations. But such
prosecutions would usually be undertaken by private
individuals concerned in the case, and so this magistracy
tended to become a sinecure. It may even have ceased
to exist after the fall of the Areiopagos. But it
seems to have revived under the restored democracy
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
for a while (if the <cite>Axiochos</cite> belongs to Aischines the
Sokratic), to sink again in the middle of the century.
At the close of the century it revives once more with
the changes in the ephebic system, and finally perishes
when the epheboi became too few to need ten officers to
supervise their morals. An account of the Sophronistai
of this later period will be given in connection with the
epheboi.</p>

<p>The strategoi<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>
exercised a superintendence over the
epheboi during their two years’ training as recruits, as
would naturally be expected. Late in the fourth century
they appear also to have been connected with the local
schools in Attica; an inscription at Eleusis, which
Girard assigns to 320 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, thanks the strategos
Derkulos for the diligence which he had shown in
supervising the education of the children there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>
Whether they exercised such functions in the days
when their military duties were more important, is
more than doubtful. But any Athenian magistrate
could interest himself in the schools, no doubt, and
intervene to check abuses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span>

<p>In the period of juvenile emancipation and increasing
luxury and indulgence for children which marked
the closing decades of the fifth century, it became
customary for conservative thinkers to look back with
longing, and no doubt idealising, eyes to the “good
old times.” The sixth and early fifth centuries came,
probably unjustly, to be regarded as the ideal age of
education, when children learned obedience and morality,
and were not pampered and depraved; when they were
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
beautiful and healthy, not pale-faced, stunted, and over-educated.</p>

<p>Listen to Aristophanes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span>
yearning for “the good old
style of education, in the days when Justice still prevailed
over Rhetoric, and good morals were still in fashion.
Then children were seen and not heard; then the boys
of each hamlet and ward walked in orderly procession
along the roads on their way to the lyre-school,&mdash;no
overcoats, though it snowed cats and dogs. Then,
while they stood up square&mdash;no lounging&mdash;the master
taught them a fine old patriotic song like ‘Pallas,
city-sacker dread,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
or ‘A cry that echoes afar,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span>
set
to a good old-fashioned tune. If any one tried any
vulgar trills and twiddles and odes where the metre
varies, such as Phrunis and Co. use nowadays, he got
a tremendous thrashing for disrespect to the Muses.”
While being taught by the paidotribes, too, they
behaved modestly, and did not spend their time ogling
their admirers. “At meals children were not allowed
to grab up the dainties or giggle or cross their feet.”
“This was the education which produced the heroes
of Marathon.… This taught the boys to avoid the
Agora, keep away from the Baths, be ashamed at what
is disgraceful, be courteous to elders, honour their
parents, and be an impersonation of Modesty&mdash;instead
of running after ballet-girls. They passed their days
in the gymnasia, keeping their bodies in good condition,
not mouthing quibbles in the Agora. Each spent his
time with some well-mannered lad of his own age,
running races in the Akademeia under the sacred olives,
amid a fragrance of smilax and leisure and white
poplar, rejoicing in the springtide when plane-tree and
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
elm whisper together.” All the voices of generations
of boys, bound down to indoor studies when wood and
field and river are calling them, the complaint of ages
of fevered hurry and bustle, looking back with regret on
the days of “leisure” and “springtide,” seem to echo in
Aristophanes’ lament for the ways that were no more.</p>

<p>“This education,” he goes on, “produced a good
chest, sound complexion, broad shoulders, small tongue;
the new style produces pale faces, small shoulders,
narrow chest, and long tongue, and makes the boy
confuse Honour with Dishonour: it fills the Baths,
empties the Palaistra.”</p>

<p>The next witness to be called is Isokrates. He is
somewhat prejudiced by his dream of restoring the
Areiopagos to its old power, but he is an educational
expert and his evidence is supported by that of many
others. In the days when the Areiopagos had the
superintendence of morals, he says,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
“the young did
not spend their time in the gambling dens, and with
flute-girls and company of that sort, as they do now,
but they remained true to the manner of life which was
laid down for them.… They avoided the Agora
so much, that, if ever they were compelled to pass
through it, they did so with obvious modesty and self-control.
To contradict or insult an elder was at that
time considered a worse offence than ill-treatment of
parents is considered now. To eat or drink in a tavern
was a thing that not even a self-respecting servant
would think of doing then; for they practised good
manners, not vulgarity.”</p>

<p>Call Plato next.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span>
“In a democratic state the schoolmaster
is afraid of his pupils and flatters them, and the
pupils despise both schoolmaster and paidagogos. The
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
young expect the same treatment as the old, and contradict
them and quarrel with them. In fact, seniors
have to flatter their juniors, in order not to be thought
morose old dotards.”</p>

<p>The counts of the indictment are luxury, bad
manners, contempt for authority, disrespect to elders,
and a love for chatter in place of exercise. The old
regime had strictly forbidden luxury. Warm baths
had been regarded as unmanly, and were even coupled
with drunkenness by Hermippos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
The boys had only
worn a single garment, the sleeveless chiton, a custom
which survived till late times in Sparta and Crete; but
at Athens they began to wear the <ins title="himation">ἱμάτιον</ins> or overcoat as
well. Xenophon, blaming parents “in the rest of
Hellas” (<span class="decoration">i.e.</span> elsewhere than in Sparta), says: “They
make their boy’s feet soft by giving him shoes, and
pamper his body with changes of clothes; they also
allow him as much food as his stomach can contain.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span>
Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of
their households. They no longer rose from their
seats when an elder entered the room; they contradicted
their parents, chattered before company, gobbled
up the dainties at table, and committed various offences
against Hellenic tastes, such as crossing their legs.
They tyrannised over the paidagogoi and schoolmasters.
Alkibiades even smacked a literature-master. A similar
change came over the position of children in England
during the latter half of the nineteenth century. If
Maria Edgeworth could have met a modern child, she
would have uttered quite Aristophanic diatribes against
the decay of good manners.</p>

<p>With this change went a more serious matter, a
change of tone. Whether the old days were as moral
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
as the conservatives supposed, may be doubted; but
the atmosphere of Periclean and Socratic Athens, as
represented by all its literary lights, was certainly most
unsuitable for the young. Perhaps general morality
was no worse, but the immorality was no longer concealed
from the children. The old laws which had
excluded unsuitable company from the schools and
palaistrai were neglected, and these educational buildings
became the resort of all the fashionable loungers
of Athens.</p>

<p>The preference given to conversation over exercise
was a feature of the age. In part, it was a preference
for intellectual as against purely physical education.
The free discussion with children of ethical subjects
probably ceased with the death of Sokrates; this can
hardly be regretted, if Plato’s evidence as to the nature
of Socratic dialogues is to be believed. From the
importance which Plato gives to gymnastics as a
corrective to exclusive <ins title="mousikê">μουσική</ins> even in the education of
his highly intellectual Philosopher-Kings, we may suspect
that the revolt against excessive athletics at Athens, of
which Euripides had been the leader, had gone too far,
and that a reaction was needed. Certainly the Athenians
do not distinguish themselves for pluck or energy in
the fourth century: in Platonic phrase, the temper
of their resolution had been melted away by their
exclusive devotion to intellectual and artistic pursuits.</p>

<p>Let me close this subject, however, with a more
pleasing picture of that <ins title="aidôs">αἰδώς</ins> or modesty at which the
older education had aimed. It is taken from the midst
of that brilliant but corrupt Socratic Athens.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
Young
Autolukos had won the boys’ contest for the pankration
at the great Panathenaic festival. As a treat,
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
Kallias, a friend of his father, had taken him to the
horse-races, and afterwards invited him out to dinner
with his father Lukon: such a dignity was rarely
accorded to an Athenian boy.</p>

<p>The boy sits at table, while the grown men recline.
Some one asked him what he was most proud of&mdash;“Your
victory, I suppose?” He blushed and said, “No, I’m
not.” Every one was delighted to hear his voice, for
he had not said a word so far. “Of what then?”
some one asked. “Of my father,” replied the boy,
and cuddled up against him.</p>

<p>These shy, blushing boys were a feature of the age.
The stricter parents, knowing the dangers which surrounded
their sons, tried to keep them entirely from
any knowledge or experience of the world.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>As far as can be discovered from the somewhat
fragmentary evidence, the Athenian type of education
was prevalent throughout the civilised Hellenic world,
with the exception of Crete and Lakedaimon, which
had systems of their own. Xenophon, in praising the
Spartan system and contrasting it with that which was
prevalent in neighbouring countries, ascribes to what he
calls “the rest of Hellas” educational customs and
arrangements exactly similar to those which are found
to have existed at Athens. His statement is borne
out by other evidence. Chios certainly had a School
of Letters before 494 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>; for a building of this
sort collapsed in that year, destroying all but one of
the 120 pupils.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
Boiotia, byword for stupidity, had
schools even in the smaller towns. A small place like
Mukalessos had more than one; for a detachment of
wild Thracian mercenaries in the pay of Athens fell
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
upon the town at daybreak one morning during the
Peloponnesian War, and entering “the largest school
in the place,” killed all the boys.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
Arkadia had an
equally bad reputation; yet, according to Polubios,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span>
in
every Arcadian town the boys were compelled by law
to learn to sing. Troizen must have had schools in
480, when she provided them for her Athenian guests.

for a
school of sixty boys in Astupalaia in 496 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> The
poet Sophocles dined with a master of letters whose
school was either in Eretria or Eruthrai.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span>
The
inscriptions show that before the third century there
were flourishing schools in most of the islands.</p>

<p>Gymnastic education must have gone on in every
Hellenic city, for the athletic victors at the great games
come from every part. Musical training too was
required for the dancing and singing which were
universal throughout Hellas; but how far the lyre was
taught must remain doubtful. In Boiotia the flute
replaced the lyre in the schools. But it may be taken
for granted that letters, some sort of music, and gymnastics
were taught in every part of civilised Hellas,
with the possible exception that letters may not have
been taught at Sparta.</p>

<p>Secondary Education, as long as it was supplied by
the Sophists, reached every village in the Hellenic
world; later, it had a tendency to be confined to the
large towns. The Tertiary system of military training
and special gymnastics for the epheboi would seem, from
the scanty evidence of the inscriptions, to have been
well-nigh universal.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to give a more detailed account
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
of the several branches of this widespread educational
system. As the evidence comes almost entirely from
Athens, my description will deal in the main with
Athenian education; but, as the same type prevailed
throughout the greater part of Hellas, the description
may be taken as applying to the other cities also.</p>

On the strength of the passages quoted from the law, and from Demosthenes,
and of Aristophanes, <cite>Clouds</cite>, 964, some have maintained a theory that the Athenian
tribes provided free education in dancing, and perhaps in other subjects, to all free
boys, exclusive of competitions. But the quotation in Aischines, except for the
actual law, which is a later interpolation, certainly refers only to the choregoi, and
the passage in Demosthenes is concerned only with chorus-dancing for competitions.
In Aristophanes the boys of the same neighbourhood naturally attend the same
school, that is all.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">ATHENS AND THE REST OF HELLAS:<br />
PRIMARY EDUCATION</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">We</span> have seen that Primary Education in Hellas consisted
of letters and music, with a contemporary training
in gymnastics; to which triple course was added, late in
the fourth century, drawing and painting. How the day
was divided between mental and physical training is
unknown&mdash;probably, like everything else, this varied
with the taste of the individual&mdash;but the following
sketch from Lucian,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span>
although it belongs to a much
later date, may perhaps give some idea of a schoolboy’s
day:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“He gets up at dawn, washes the sleep from his
eyes, and puts on his cloak. Then he goes out from
his father’s house, with his eyes fixed upon the ground,
not looking at any one who meets him. Behind him
follow attendants and paidagogoi, bearing in their hands
the implements of virtue, writing-tablets or books containing
the great deeds of old, or, if he is going to a
music-school, his well-tuned lyre.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When he has laboured diligently at intellectual
studies, and his mind is sated with the benefits of the
school curriculum, he exercises his body in liberal
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
pursuits, riding or hurling the javelin or spear. Then
the wrestling-school with its sleek, oiled pupils, labours
under the mid-day sun, and sweats in the regular athletic
contests. Then a bath, not too prolonged; then a
meal, not too large, in view of afternoon school. For
the schoolmasters are waiting for him again, and the
books which openly or by allegory teach him who was
a great hero, who was a lover of justice and purity.
With the contemplation of such virtues he waters the
garden of his young soul. When evening sets a limit
to his work, he pays the necessary tribute to his stomach
and retires to rest, to sleep sweetly after his busy day.”</p>

<p>The school hours were naturally arranged to suit the
times of Hellenic meals, for which the boys returned
home. The ordinary arrangement was a light breakfast
at daybreak, a solid meal at mid-day, and supper at
sunset. So the schools opened at sunrise.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span>

in time to allow the boys to return home to lunch,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span>
opened again in the afternoon, and closed before sunset.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span>
How many of the intermediate hours were spent in
work,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
and what intervals there were, is unknown.
There was, of course, no weekly rest on Sundays; but
festivals, which were whole holidays, were numerous
throughout Hellas, and, in Alexandria at any rate, on
the 7th and 20th of every month the schools were closed,
these days being sacred to Apollo.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>
There were also
special school festivals, such as that of the Muses, and
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
holidays in commemoration of benefactors; thus Anaxagoras
left a bequest to Klazomenai, on condition that
the day of his death should be celebrated annually by a
holiday in the schools.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
It must also be remembered
that one of the three branches of Primary Education in
Hellas would be called play in England: an afternoon
spent in running races, jumping, wrestling, or riding
would not be regarded as work by an English schoolboy.
Music, too, is usually learned during play-hours in an
English school. Even Letters, when the elementary
stage was past, meant reciting, reading, or learning by
heart the literature of the boy’s own language, and most
of it not stiff literature by any means, but such fascinating
fairy-tales as are found in Homer. There is little
trace of Hellenic boys creeping unwillingly to school:
their lessons were made eminently attractive.</p>

<p>Of the fees which were paid to schoolmasters little
is known. An amusing passage in Lucian,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span>
dealing
with the under-world, describes those who had been
kings or satraps upon earth as reduced in the future
state “to beggary, and compelled by poverty either to
sell kippers or to teach the elements of reading and
writing.” From this it may be inferred that elementary
schoolmasters did not make much money by
their fees. This inference is supported by the fact that
even the poorest Athenians managed to send their sons
to such schools. Plato in the <cite>Laws</cite> reserves the
profession for foreigners, thus suggesting that it was
neither well paid nor highly esteemed. To call a man
a schoolmaster was almost an insult; Demosthenes,
abusing Aischines, says, “You taught letters, I went
to school.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span>
The weakness of the masters’ position may
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
be seen too from the extreme contempt with which their
pupils seem to have treated them. The boys bring
their pets&mdash;cats and dogs and leopards&mdash;into school,
and play with them under the master’s chair. Theophrastos,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span>
in describing the characteristics of the mean
man, says that “he does not send his children to school
all the month of Anthesterion” (that is, from the middle
of February to the middle of March) “on account of
the number of feasts.” The school-bills were paid by
the month, and, since boys did not go to school on the
great festivals, and Anthesterion contained many such
days, the mean parent thought he would not get his
money’s worth for this particular month, and so withdrew
his boys while it lasted.</p>

<p>Mean parents also deducted from the fees in
proportion, if their sons were absent from school owing
to ill-health for a day or two;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span>
but this was not
usually done. The bills were paid on the 30th of each
month.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
Schoolmasters apparently had some difficulty
in getting their bills paid at all; according to
Demosthenes’ statement, his bills were never paid,
owing to the fraudulent behaviour of his guardian
Aphobos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
</p>

<p>No doubt the fees varied according to the merits
of the school, for the schools at Athens seem to have
differed greatly. Demosthenes, when boasting of his
career, in his speech <cite>On the Crown</cite>, says that he
went as a boy to the <em>respectable</em> schools;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>
the quality
and quantity of the teaching must have been varied
to suit the parent’s pocket. For the poor there would
probably be schools where only the elements of reading
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
and writing were taught. In the higher class of school
these elements would be taught by under-masters,
frequently slaves; but free citizens might also be
reduced by poverty to take such a post. This may be
seen from the case of the father of Aischines, the
orator.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
Impoverished and exiled like many democrats
by the Thirty Tyrants, he returned with the Restoration
a ruined man. To earn his living, he became an usher
at the school of one Elpias, close to the Theseion,
and taught letters: his son Aischines seems to have
begun his life by assisting his father in this occupation.
His opponent, Demosthenes, takes advantage of the
contempt with which these ushers were regarded to
declare that the father was a slave of Elpias,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span>
“wearing
big fetters and a collar,” and the son was employed in
“grinding the ink and sponging the forms and sweeping
out the schoolroom (<ins title="paidagôgeion">παιδαγωγεῖον</ins>), the work of a
servant, not of a free boy.”</p>

<p>No doubt letters and music were often taught at
the same school, in different rooms. Such an arrangement
would be natural and convenient. The vases
suggest it, but their evidence is uncertain. The school
buildings seem often to have been surrounded by playgrounds.
A passage in Aelian<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>
shows us the boys,
just let out of school, playing at tug-of-war. No
doubt in these places they played with their hoops
and tops, and amused themselves with pick-a-back and
the stone- and dice-games which corresponded to our
marbles. In villages these playgrounds probably did
duty as palaistrai.</p>

<p>The headmaster of the school sat on a chair with a
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
high back; under-masters and boys had stools without
backs, but cushions were provided. For lessons in
class there were benches.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
There was a high reading-desk
for recitations. Round the walls hung writing-tablets,
rulers, and baskets or cases containing manuscript
rolls labelled with the author’s name, composing the
school library; the rolls might also hang by themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>
Masters were expected to possess at any rate a copy of
Homer&mdash;Alkibiades thrashed one who did not. Sometimes
they emended their edition themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span>
In the
music-schools hung lyres and flutes and flute-cases.
The (<ins title="paidagôgeion">παιδαγωγειον</ins>) mentioned by Demosthenes may have
been an anteroom where the paidagogoi sat, but more
probably the word is only a rhetorical variant for
“schoolroom.” There were often busts of the Muses
round the walls,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
which were also decorated with vases,
serving for domestic purposes, and, perhaps, illustrating
with their pictures the books which the boys were
reading. At a later date, at any rate, a series of
cartoons, illustrating scenes in the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite>,
were sometimes hung upon the walls: the “Tabula
Iliaca,” now in the Capitoline Museum, has been
recognised as a fragment of such a series.</p>

<p>The first stage was to learn to read and write.
Instead of a slate, boys in Hellas had tablets of wax,
usually made in two halves, so as to fold on a hinge
in the middle, the waxen surfaces coming inwards and
so being protected. Sometimes there were three pieces,
forming a triptych, or even more. For pencil, they
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
had an instrument with a sharp point at one end,
suitable for making marks on the wax, and a flat
surface at the other, which was used to erase what had
been written, and so make the tablets ready for future
use. These tablets are shown in the school-scenes on the
fifth-century vases.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
At a later period, when parchment
and papyrus became more common, these materials were
used in the schools. Lines could be ruled with a lump
of lead, and writing done either with ink and a reed pen
or with lead; for erasures a sponge was employed.</p>

<p>The early stages of learning to write are described
in the <cite>Protagoras</cite> of Plato.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span>
“When a boy is not
yet clever at writing, the masters first draw lines, and
then give him the tablet and make him write as the
lines direct.” The passage has been variously interpreted.
Some regard the master as merely writing a
series of letters which the boy is to copy underneath.
The word used in Greek for the master’s writing is
<ins title="hypograpsantes">ὑπογράψαντες</ins>, and it is significant that the word for
a “copy” in this sense is a derivative of this word,
<ins title="hypogrammos">ὑπογραμμός</ins>. Such a copy, corresponding to the
phrases like “England exports engines” or “Germany
grows grapes,” which are employed in English schools
for this purpose, is extant.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span>
It is a nonsense sentence
designed to contain all the letters of the alphabet
<ins title="marpte sphinx klôps zbychthêdon">μάρπτε σφὶγξ κλὼψ ζβυχθηδόν</ins>. If this rendering is
correct, the master wrote a sentence of this sort on
the tablets, and the boy copied it underneath. Others
interpret the lines which the master draws on the
tablet as parallel straight lines, within which the boy
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
had to write. Just such a device is often employed
in English copy-books. The word used for “lines,”
<ins title="grammai">γραμμαί</ins>, usually means “straight lines,” which supports
this interpretation. But <ins title="hypographê">ὑπογραφή</ins>, on the other hand,
a derivative of <ins title="hypographein">ὑπογράφειν</ins>, is used for irregular traces,
<span class="decoration">e.g.</span> a footstep,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span>
and <ins title="hypographein">ὑπογράφειν</ins> itself is a technical
term in Hellenic art for “sketching in” what is afterwards
to be finished in detail. Consequently a third
rendering of the passage makes the master draw a
faint, rough outline of the various letters, and the boy
has to go over them with his pen, marking the grooves
in the wax deeper and filling in the details. For
example, in England, the master might draw |·| and
the boy go over the two vertical lines and draw in
the other two, M. Thus all three interpretations are
sensible and rest on good authority. But surely the
master may be regarded as adopting all three processes,
according to the intelligence of the pupils. For the
beginner he would outline the whole letter, and leave
him only the task of going over it again. Then he
would gradually give less and less help, till the boy was
capable of writing the letters with the assistance of the
parallel lines alone. Finally these would be withdrawn,
and the boy would be left to write his imitation of the
copy without assistance. The phrase in Plato is purposely
vague, and will include the whole of this process.</p>

<p>The letters were written in lines horizontal and
vertical, so that they fell beneath one another. No
stops or accents were inserted, and no spaces were left
between words. The writing-master probably ruled
both the horizontal and the vertical lines on the tablet
for his pupil. On the Vase of Douris,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>
an under-master
is represented as writing with his pen on
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
a wax tablet, while a boy stands in front of him. He
is probably meant either to be writing a copy or else
correcting his pupil’s exercise. Over his head hangs a
ruler, for marking out the guiding lines on the tablet.
Behind the boy sits a bearded man with a staff, who is
probably the paidagogos. The boys in the class are
clearly coming up one by one to receive their copies or
have their exercises corrected, while the rest are doing
their writing. It will be noticed that there is no desk
or table: the Hellenes wrote with their tablets on their
knees.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy had acquired a certain facility in
writing, he entered the dictation class. The master read
out something, and the boys wrote it down.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>
At first,
of course, very simple words would be dictated, and
there would not be much to write. But, later on, the
boys would write at his dictation passages of the poets
and other authors. For this purpose, ink and parchment
may sometimes have been employed: Aischines
seems to have “ground ink”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span>
for a writing-school.
Various “elaborations in the way of speed and beauty”
of writing seem to have been customary in the case of
more advanced pupils.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
Possibly they learnt to make
flourishes and ornamental letters. Speed would naturally
be taught, for it was usual to take notes at the lectures
of Sophists and Philosophers, and speed is required
for this purpose. This must have involved the use
of the cursive letters, which otherwise were not needed,
for the Hellene had not very much writing to do,
unless he became a clerk to a public body.</p>

<p>Learning to read must have been a difficult business
in Hellas, for books were written in capitals at this
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
time. There were no spaces between the words, and no
stops were inserted. Thus, the reader had to exercise
much ingenuity before he could arrive at the meaning
of a sentence. Still more difficult for the boys to grasp
was the Attic accent, upon which the masters set a great
importance. So difficult was it, that few foreigners
ever acquired it, and a born Athenian, if he went abroad
for a few years, often lost the power of speaking with
the Attic intonation. The first step in learning to read
is to acquire the alphabet. The Hellenes, wishing, as
usual, to make learning as easy as possible, seem to have
put the alphabet into verse. A metrical alphabet,
ascribed to Kallias, a contemporary of Perikles, is still
extant, but in a mutilated form, which has been restored
in several not very convincing ways. Probably it has
been adapted to suit different alphabets, for there were
several current in different parts of Hellas. The following
is a conjectural <span class="lock">restoration:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This complete alphabet of twenty-four letters, which
appears in modern Greek Grammars, was not adopted
for official purposes at Athens till 403 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, “but it is
clear that it was in ordinary use at Athens considerably
earlier.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>This metrical alphabet formed the prologue to what
may be called a spelling-drama, in which the whole
process of learning to spell was expressed either in
iambic lines or in choral songs. Since its author,
Kallias, is coupled with Strattis, the comic poet,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
it
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
may be inferred that the play was a comedy, not a
tragedy; the chorus would then be twenty-four in
number. Each member of the chorus represented one
of the twenty-four letters. In the first choric song the
letters were put together in pairs, in the fashion of a
spelling class. The first strophé runs as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">In the corresponding antistrophé Gamma was similarly
coupled with the seven vowels, and so on apparently
through the alphabet. During the song, which was set
to excellent music, the members of the chorus, dressed
to represent the letters quite clearly, and no doubt
posturing in the right attitude, would form themselves
into the required pairs. Thus, during the first line
Beta and Alpha would come together, during the second
Beta and Ei, and so on. After this song came a lecture
on the vowels, in iambic verse, the chorus being told to
repeat them one by one after the speaker. There seems
to have been a plot of some sort in this extraordinary
drama, but the main interest was, no doubt, the spelling.
Opportunities were also taken for describing the shapes
of the letters, the audience having to guess what letter
was intended. This kind of alphabetical puzzle seems to
have caught the popular fancy at Athens, for Euripides,
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
Agathon, and Theodektes all employed it. In each
case the concealed word was “Theseus.”</p>

<span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the same spirit, Sophocles, in his satyric drama
<cite>Amphiaraos</cite>, introduced an actor who represented
the shapes of the letters by his dancing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span>
Periclean
Athens seems to have taken a very keen interest in
matters of spelling: the audience must all have known
their letters, or such devices could never have become
so popular.</p>

<p>Kallias’ play is the ancestor of such books as
<cite>Reading without Tears</cite>. His dramatic presentation
of the process of spelling must have caught the imagination
and impressed the memory of many Athenian boys.
It may even be suspected that his method was adopted
in enterprising schools, and spelling lessons were conducted
to a tune, perhaps even accompanied by dancing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span>
The tunes of Kallias were highly praised, and were, no
doubt, very different from the monotonous drone which
announces to the outside world the presence of a Board
School.</p>

<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
To return to more prosaic methods. Plato gives an
interesting sketch<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span>
of a reading class. “When boys
have just learnt their letters, they recognise any of them
readily enough in the shortest and easiest syllables, and
are able to give a correct answer about them. But in
the longer and more difficult syllables they are not
certain, but form a wrong opinion and answer wrongly.
Then the best way is to take them back to the syllables
in which they recognise the same letters and then compare
them with those in which they made mistakes, and,
putting them side by side, show that in both combinations
the same letters have the same meaning.”</p>

<p>Take an English example. The master writes
<span class="sc lowercase">SCRAPE</span> on the blackboard and asks the boys to tell
him what letters it contains. The class fail to recognise
the letters: the word is too long and difficult. The
master then writes beside it consecutively <span class="sc lowercase">APE</span>, <span class="sc lowercase">RAPE</span>,
<span class="sc lowercase">CAPE</span>, in all of which the boys recognise the letters
correctly. Then <span class="sc lowercase">CRAPE</span> and <span class="sc lowercase">SCRAP</span>. From these
he passes on to <span class="sc lowercase">SCRAPE</span>, which they now recognise by
analogy from the words which they know already.
“Finally, they learn always to give the same name to
the same letter whenever it comes.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The methods by which boys learn to spell are the
same in all ages. “When boys come together to learn
their letters, they are asked what letters there are in
some word or other.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
A certain amount of mental
arithmetic seems to have been included in this stage
of spelling: the pupils were asked <em>how many</em> letters
there were in a word, as well as the order in which
they were arranged.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
But this will be discussed
later.</p>

<p><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
While the boys were still unable to read, and often
afterwards owing to the comparative scarcity of books,
the master dictated to them the poetry which he intended
them to learn by heart, and they repeated it
after him.</p>

<p>The Kulix of Douris gives an interesting picture of
either a reading or a repetition lesson.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>

chair sits an elderly master, holding a roll in
his hand. On it is inscribed what is clearly meant to
be an hexameter line from some epic poet, but Douris
was not very well educated, and so the line is misspelt
and will not scan. In front of the master stands a boy,
behind whom sits an elderly man who is probably, as in
the writing scene, a paidagogos. The master may be
dictating the poem while the boy learns it by heart after
him, or he may be hearing him say it. But very
possibly the scene represents a reading-lesson. The
attitudes of boy and master are not very convenient, if
both are reading out of the same book; but this was
unavoidable, for, owing to the canons of vase-painting,
the figures could only be full-faced or in profile, and
the front of the manuscript had to be turned in such a
way as to be legible.</p>

<p>On the walls of the school hang a manuscript rolled
up and tied with a string, and an ornamental basket.
These baskets were used as bookcases, to hold the
manuscript rolls. They may sometimes be seen on
vases suspended over the heads of reading figures, as in
the British Museum vase,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span>
which represents a woman
reading a scroll. The paidagogos, we may notice, is
revealing his humble origin by crossing his feet, a
serious offence against good manners in Hellas.</p>

<p>“When the boys knew their letters and were
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
beginning to understand what was written, the masters
put beside them on the benches the works of good poets
for them to read, and made them learn them by heart.
They chose for this purpose poets that contained many
moral precepts, and narratives and praises of the heroes
of old, in order that the boy might admire them and
imitate them and desire to become such a man himself.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
It is noteworthy that Hellenic boys began at once
with the very best literature to be found in their
language: there was no preliminary course of childish
tales. Grammar, when invented, was taught at a later
stage: the boys plunged straight into literature.</p>

<p>The schoolmasters at Athens differed as to which
was the best way of introducing boys to their national
literature. The great majority held that a properly
educated boy ought to be saturated in all poetry, comic
and serious, hearing much of it in the reading class, and
learning much of it&mdash;in fact, whole poets&mdash;by heart.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span>
A minority would pick out the leading passages,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
the
“purple patches,” and certain whole speeches,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
and put
them together and have them committed to memory.
Plato argued in favour of expurgated editions of passages
carefully selected according to a very strict standard,
since much in literature was good and much bad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Homer, of course, played the largest part in these
literary studies; from early times “he was given an
honourable place in the teaching of the young.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>
Vast
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
quantities of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite> were learnt by
heart. Nikeratos, in Xenophon,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>
says: “My father,
wishing me to grow up into a good man, made me
learn all the lines of Homer; and now I can repeat the
whole of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite> from memory.” Such
prodigious feats were, no doubt, assisted by the rhapsodes,
who could be heard at Athens declaiming Homer
“nearly every day.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>
The Hellenes did not let their
greatest poet lie neglected, to be “revived” at long
intervals. Homer was supposed to teach everything,
especially soldiering and good morals. “I suppose you
know,” continues Nikeratos,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span>
 “that Homer, the wisest
of men, has written about all human matters. So whoever
of you wishes to excel as a householder or public
speaker or general, or desires to become like Achilles
or Aias or Nestor or Odusseus, let him come to me.”
Then he proceeds to show how, for example, the poet
gives full directions about the proper way to drive a
chariot in a race. Aristophanes<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span>
makes the shade of
Aeschylus say, “Whence did divine Homer win his
honour and renown, save from this, that he taught drill,
courage, the arming of troops? Many a man of valour
he trained, and our own dead hero, Lamachos. I took
my print from him, and represented many deeds of
valour done by a Patroklos or lion-hearted Teukros, to
rouse my countrymen to model themselves upon such
men, when they heard the trumpet sound.”</p>

<p>The great poet does not seem to have been taught
pedantically; the attention of the boys was not concentrated
simply on the difficulties of the Homeric
vocabulary. In fact, probably they were little troubled
with such points; the sense, the rhythm, and the beauty
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
of the original do not depend upon an exact understanding
of every word, as many a modern reader has
discovered. In a fragment of Aristophanes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>
a father
asks his son the meaning of some hard words in Homer,
such as <ins title="amenêna karêna">ἀμένηνα κάρηνα</ins> and <ins title="korymba">κόρυμβα</ins>; the son is quite
unable to translate them, at any rate when separated
from their context, and can only retort by asking his
father to interpret some archaic phrases in Solon’s laws.
A later comic poet<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span>
introduced a cook who insisted on
using Homeric language, just as a modern <em>chef</em> writes
his <em>menu</em> in French; the man who has hired him is
ludicrously unable to understand his phrases, and has to
go in search of a commentary.</p>

<p>Explanations and interpretations of supposed moral
allegories in Homer, and lessons drawn from a close
study of his characters, were very popular in Hellas,
and no doubt figured in the schools.</p>

<p>If Homer occupied the first place in literary education,
other leading authors were not neglected. All
the great poets were made useful. “Orpheus taught
ceremonial rites and abstinence from bloodshed, and
Mousaios medicine and oracles, and Hesiod the tillage
of land, the seasons of fruits and ploughing.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span>
Hesiod
probably served more as a theological handbook than as
a manual of agriculture; the moral precepts to Perses
in the <cite>Works and Days</cite> probably also found favour
with schoolmasters. The fourth-century comic poet
Alexis gives an interesting catalogue of a school
library.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
Besides Orpheus, Hesiod, and Homer, who
have been mentioned already, there are Epicharmos,
Choirilos, the author of an epic poem on the Persian
war, and what is called vaguely “tragedy,” probably
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
meaning a selection from the great tragedians. We can
see from Plato’s attacks that Aeschylus and Euripides
must have been important in the schools, and we know
that Athenian gentlemen were expected to be able to
recite them at dinner-parties, and must therefore have
learnt them by heart. The vague words “tragedy”
and “comedy” are similarly used of the recitations of
the boys at Teos. Various editions of moral precepts
were also popular. Among these were <cite>The Precepts
of Cheiron</cite>, or Cheironeia, supposed to have been given
by the wise Centaur to his pupil Achilles and put
into verse by Hesiod; on a vase at Berlin three boys
are seen reading this work with apparent interest.
The extant lines of Theognis are often supposed to
represent a school edition of the poet’s works, containing
the more improving portions. The lyric poets
were taught at the lyre-school, and I shall discuss them
later.</p>

<p>Alexis also mentions “all sorts of prose works” in
the school library. The only one of these to which he
gives a more definite name is a cookery-book by Simos.
But that is only introduced for the sake of a joke; such
a work would not, of course, figure in an Athenian
school. Aesop may have been a prose work read in
schools; it was considered the sign of an ignoramus
“not to have thumbed Aesop,” or to be able to quote
him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
Such moral works as Prodikos’ <cite>Choice of
Herakles</cite> were probably popular in schools. The
case of Lusis in Plato suggests that some of the old
nature-philosophers may have been read. No doubt
the school library varied according to the taste of the
master, and his freedom of choice may have led to some
curious selections. But on the whole prose works very
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
rarely figured in the elementary schools, partly because
they were usually too technical, still more because the
artistic and literary sense of the Hellenes regarded
poetry, if only because of its greater beauty and its
imaginative value, as better for educational purposes
than prose.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that when boys recited
Homer or Aeschylus or Euripides, they acted them,
delivering even the narrative with a great deal of
gesture, and dramatising the speeches as fully as they
could. The almost daily recitations of the rhapsodes,
and the frequent dramatic performances in the theatres,
gave them plenty of examples of the way to act. The
Hellenes were extremely sensitive and sympathetic:
they were a nation of actors. The rhapsode Ion tells
Plato that, when he recited Homer, his eyes watered
and his hair stood on end. This may give the modern
reader some idea of what his repetition-lesson meant to
a boy at Athens. More may be gathered from Plato’s
vehement denunciations of dramatisation in poetry
intended for use in schools; he believed that this continuous
acting exerted an evil influence upon character.
But this question will be discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The schoolrooms were used as the scene of lectures,
to which grown-up men were invited; probably the
lectures would be given to the boys at a different time.
The wandering teacher, Hippias of Elis, meeting
Sokrates one day, invited him to such a lecture, which,
from its subject, was clearly meant mainly for the
young.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span>
After the fall of Troy, according to the story
which Hippias invented for the occasion, Neoptolemos
asked the wise old Nestor what was good and honourable
conduct and what manner of life would cause a
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
young man to win renown. Given this convenient
opening, Nestor replied by suggesting many excellent
rules of conduct. Hippias had delivered this lecture at
Sparta, where it had won great applause. He now
proposes, he says, “to deliver it the day after to-morrow
in the schoolroom of Pheidostratos, and to
impart much other valuable information at the same
time, at the request of Eudikos son of Apemantos.
Mind you come and bring any friends who will be
capable of appreciating what I say.” No doubt it was
a very excellent little sermon on the duties of life,
closely analogous to Prodikos’ famous <cite>Choice of
Herakles</cite>, and most improving for the pupils of
Pheidostratos, if they were allowed to attend.</p>

<p>One charming picture of two Athenian school
friends,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>
in their sleeveless tunics, is extant. “I saw
you, Sokrates,” says a guest at a dinner-party, “when
you and Kritoboulos at the School of Letters were both
looking for something in the same book, putting your
head against his, and your bare shoulder against his
shoulder.”</p>

<p>It is also recorded that the Athenians were great
hands at nicknames:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span>
it may be inferred that this
peculiarity extended also to their schoolboys.</p>

<p>A vivid picture of school life has recently come to
light in the third Mime of Herondas. It belongs to
the Alexandrian period in point of date, but many of
its details will, no doubt, suit the Athenian schools just
as well; it is, however, quite inconceivable that gags
and fetters were used as punishments at Athens in the
schools.</p>

<p>The exact age at which arithmetic was taught to
boys at Athens involves a somewhat complicated inquiry.
The arrangements which Plato makes in the <cite>Republic</cite>
and <cite>Laws</cite> defer this subject till the age of sixteen. In
the <cite>Laws</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
he says: “It remains to discuss, first the
question of Letters, and secondly that of the Lyre and
practical arithmetic&mdash;by which I mean so much as is
necessary for purposes of war and household management
and the work of government.” His citizens will
also require, he thinks, enough astronomy to make the
calendar intelligible to them. In this passage he distinctly
couples practical arithmetic with music; and
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
when he proceeds to detail, he makes the study of the
lyre last from thirteen to sixteen, and then deals with
arithmetic, the weights and measures, and the astronomical
calendar, studies which terminate with the seventeenth
year. This course is designed for all the free
boys in his State: it is to be noticed that it is eminently
practical, elementary, and concrete. In the <cite>Republic</cite>
he is educating a few picked boys: before they are
eighteen they are to have gone through a course of
abstract and theoretical mathematics, the Theory of
Numbers, Plane and Solid Geometry, Kinetics and
Harmonics. Thus he mentions two sorts of mathematics,
the one practical and concrete, called by the
Hellenes <ins title="logistikê">λογιστική</ins>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span>
whose object is mainly mercantile,
and the other theoretical and abstract, which they called
<ins title="arithmêtikê">ἀριθμητική</ins>. Both sorts are to be learned in the period
next before the eighteenth year.</p>

<p>But it must not be assumed that this was the case
at Athens. The philosopher is dealing with an ideal
State, where education can be arranged in the theoretically
best way, not with the real Athens, where the boy
might be called away to the counting-house or the
farm at any moment, and many did not stay at school
after they had once learned to read and write. Moreover
Plato, as a good Pythagorean, saw a peculiar
appropriateness in making numbers follow music, and
his Dorian sympathies made him divide up education
into clearly marked periods, in each of which only one
subject was taught. This arrangement, I have already
shown, did not find favour at Athens.</p>

<p>His system must, then, be received with caution.
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
It is inherently far more probable that the simpler,
practical arithmetic would be taught at the elementary
schools of letters, which all citizens, including future
tradesmen and artisans, attended, not at some later
date in a separate school. But can any evidence be
found for such an arrangement? Yes, Plato himself
in the <cite>Laws</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>
declares that the future builder ought to
play with toy bricks and learn weights and measurements
when he is a child. His builder, at any rate,
cannot wait to learn arithmetic till he is sixteen.
Then, in the same work, he quotes the instance of
Egypt, where “a very large number of children learn
practical arithmetic <em>simultaneously with their letters</em>,”
and he goes on to commend the methods by which it
was taught. Now Egypt in the <cite>Laws</cite> is represented
as the home of ideal education, a sort of Utopia.
Again, in Plato<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span>
Protagoras blames his brother Sophists
for “leading their pupils <em>back</em>, much against their wish,
and casting them <em>again</em> into the sciences from which
they have escaped, practical arithmetic and astronomy
and geometry and music.” How could the Sophists<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span>
be described as “leading them back and casting them
again” into studies from which they had escaped?
Where had they learnt these subjects before they were
fourteen? It could only have been at school. But
what the Sophists taught must have been new to the
boys, or they would not have paid to learn it. It was
new, because the Sophists taught the advanced and
theoretical stages, which appear in the <cite>Republic</cite>, and the
elementary schoolmasters taught the simpler and concrete
elements of arithmetic, weights and measures,
and the calendar, described in the <cite>Laws</cite>, which were
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
necessary to every Athenian citizen. From all this
it may be assumed that the Athenian boys, like Plato’s
Egyptian boys, learnt simple arithmetic, weights and
measures, and perhaps the calendar, “simultaneously
with their letters.”</p>

<p>Now there are two passages in Xenophon which
seem to suit this view. They are not conclusive in
themselves, but they give a valuable hint. In the first<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span>
it is stated that any one who knows his letters could
say <em>how many</em> letters there are in “Sokrates,” and in
what order they occur. In the second,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span>
in the course
of an argument, two illustrations are used, in close
connection with one another. The passage runs:&mdash;“Take
the case of Letters. Suppose some one asks
you how many letters there are in ‘Sokrates,’ and
which are they?… Or take the case of Numbers.
Suppose some one asks what is twice five?” These two
quotations certainly make simple counting a part of
learning letters, with which study the second passage
also closely connects the multiplication table. It would
seem that it was part of a spelling lesson to answer such
questions as “How many letters in ‘Sokrates’?”
Answer, “Eight.” “Where does R come?” Answer,
“Fourth.” It may be noticed also that the symbols of
the numerals in ancient Hellas were, with one or two
exceptions, identical with the current alphabet. The
games with cubic dice and knucklebones, to which the
boys were much addicted, must also have needed some
arithmetical skill. The natural conclusion is that
simple arithmetic, with, probably, the weights and
measures, and the outlines of the calendar, were taught
by the letter-master: the practice of music by the
music-master: while the theory of numbers, of
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
astronomy, and of music were taught by the Sophists
to <ins title="meirakia">μειράκια</ins>.</p>

<p>Simple counting was done on the fingers. “Reckon
on your fingers,” says a character in Aristophanes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span>
“not with pebbles.” A common word for counting
was <ins title="pempazein">πεμπάζειν</ins>, “to reckon on the five fingers”; the
division of the month into three periods of ten days
can be traced to the same custom. But by various
devices it was possible to count up to very large
numbers on the fingers. Pebbles were also employed
to assist in arithmetic. In the case of complicated
accounts a reckoning board (<ins title="abakos">ἄβακος</ins> or <ins title="abax">ἄβαξ</ins>) was used,
on which the pebbles varied in value according to their
position. Such boards go back to early days at Athens,
for Solon compared the life of a courtier to a pebble
upon them, since he was now worth much and now
little.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span>
A character in a fourth-century comedy<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span>
sends
for an abacus and pebbles, in order that he may do his
accounts. The pebbles were arranged in grooves,
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
being worth one or ten or a hundred and so forth,
according to the groove in which they were placed.
If they were put on the left-hand side of the board,
their value was multiplied by five.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span>
The various
games of <ins title="pessoi">πεσσοί</ins>, which somewhat resembled chess, were
played on a somewhat similar board to this, and these
chess-boards were known as <ins title="abakes">ἄβακες</ins>. Now the art of
playing with <ins title="pessoi">πεσσοί</ins> is more than once coupled by
Plato with arithmetic or mathematics generally in such
a way as to show that the game must have involved
mathematical skill.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span>
As was usual in Athens, instruction
went hand in hand with amusement, and, in
playing games, the boys learned arithmetic willingly.
A similar value seems to have attached to the game of
knucklebones, which the boys in the <cite>Lusis</cite> are found
playing during their whole holiday. Each boy carried
a large basket of knucklebones, and the loser in each
game paid so many of them over to the winner. The
art of playing this game is also coupled with mathematics
by Plato;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span>
so it must at any rate have
encouraged the study of arithmetic, in his opinion. In
the school scene of the British Museum amphora, a
little bag, usually supposed to contain knucklebones, is
figured: so they may even have been used in schools
for teaching arithmetic. In another school scene this
bag is present with a lyre and ruler; so it was evidently
part of the school furniture.</p>

<p>After such revelations of Hellenic educational
methods, it is natural to suppose that the ingenious
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
devices by which the “Egyptians,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span>
according to Plato,
“make simple arithmetic into a game” for their
children, were really used in Attica. One of these
devices<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span>
was as follows. The master took, say, sixty
apples. First he divided them among two boys, who
were made to count their share, thirty each; then
among three boys, twenty each; then among four,
fifteen each; then among five, twelve each; and then
among six, ten each. This would teach the system of
factors. Then, again, a real or imaginary competition
in boxing or wrestling<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span>
was arranged, say in a class of
nine. The boys would work out, by actual experiment,
how many fights would be necessary, if each boy had to
fight all the others one by one, and how many if a
system of rounds and byes was introduced. This might
even teach Permutations and Combinations.</p>

<p>In another case a number of bowls, some containing
mixed coins, gold, silver, and bronze, some all of one sort,
would be handed round the class. The boys would
have to count them, add and subtract them, and so on.
Thus they would learn addition and subtraction of
money, and would also gain a clear knowledge of the
national coinage.</p>

<p>Plato was immensely impressed with the educational
value of Arithmetic. “Those who are born with a
talent for it,” he says, “are quick at all learning; while
even those who are slow at it, have their general intelligence
much increased by studying it.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span>
 “No
branch of education is so valuable a preparation for
household management and politics, and all arts and
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
crafts, sciences and professions, as arithmetic; best of
all, by some divine art, it arouses the dull and sleepy
brain, and makes it studious, mindful, and sharp.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The question of the more advanced stages of Mathematics,
which were taught to older boys, may be left
for the chapter on Secondary Education.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>The chief and often the sole instrument taught in
the music school was the seven-stringed lyre,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span>
with a
large sounding-board originally made of a tortoise’s
shell.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span>
It might be played either with the hand or else
with the “plektron” or striker; the boy Lusis had
learnt to do either.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span>
The boys were also taught how
to tighten and relax the strings by turning the pegs till
the proper degree of tension was obtained. They
brought their own lyre with them from home, the
paidagogos carrying it behind his charge. This was a
wise regulation from the master’s point of view; for
the boys seem to have usually ruined these instruments
by their early efforts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span>
Like the piano, the lyre required
great delicacy of touch and very agile fingers,
and these qualities could only be obtained by continual
practice.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
</p>

<p>As would naturally be expected, individual tuition
was usual in the lyre-school; instrumental music
cannot be learnt in class. The vases make this point
quite clear. The master has a single boy seated in
front of him; both hold lyres in their hands, to which
they are singing, the words of the song being sometimes
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
represented by a string of little dots. In
<a href="#i04">Plate <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></a>, on the left of this group, a boy is coming up
to take his turn, lyre in hand, while behind him stands
his paidagogos, leaning on a reading-desk and following
his charge with his eyes. On the right is a boy just
taking up his flute-case and preparing to depart, while
another sits in the corner, wrapped in his cloak, waiting
for his turn to take a lesson. In <a href="#i03">Plate <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></a>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span>
the
master is playing a barbitos and apparently singing,
while the pupil plays the flute. On the left is a flute-master
playing, and a pupil just leaving him, flute in
hand. Another pupil, with a lyre, is waiting to take a
lesson from the master in the centre, and is amusing
himself meanwhile by playing with an animal that is
probably a leopard,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span>
like that which figures in <a href="#i04">Plate
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></a> Another pet, a dog, is howling in disgust at
the music. On the right, a pupil with a flute is
advancing to take a lesson from the flute-master in front
of him. Behind him follows a young man, who may be
an elder brother replacing the customary paidagogos
for the nonce, or an admirer. In the background sits
a small child, sucking his thumb, probably the younger
brother of one of the pupils, who has come, in accordance
with Aristotle’s advice, to look on, although still
too young to learn.</p>

<p>As soon as his pupils knew how to play, the master
taught them the works of the great lyric poets,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span>
which
were not taught in the school of letters. These were
set to music, and the boys sang them and played the
accompaniment. Every gentleman at Athens was
expected to be able to sing and play in this manner
when he went out to a dinner-party. The custom,
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
however, began to become unfashionable during the
Peloponnesian War. When old Strepsiades, in the
<cite>Clouds</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
asked Pheidippides to take the lyre and sing a
song of Simonides, his new-fashioned son replies that
playing the lyre was quite out of date, and singing over
the wine was only fit for a slave-woman at the grindstone.
Whether this state of feeling continued and
whether it had a prejudicial effect on the music-schools
cannot be decided. Sometimes the guests brought
their boys to sing to the company: in the <cite>Peace</cite> the
son of the hero Lamachos is going to sing Homer, while
the coward Kleonumos’ boy has a song of Archilochos
ready. Alkaios and Anakreon were also favourites;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span>
the lyric portions of Kratinos’ comedies, too, are
mentioned as sung at banquets:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>
no doubt, the same
was true of the other great comedians. As the iambic
parts of Aeschylus and Euripides were recited at the
dinner-table, it is natural to suppose that their songs
were also sung. The aged Dikasts in the <cite>Wasps</cite> sing
the choruses from Phrunichos’ <cite>Sidonians</cite>. Old songs
like Lamprokles’ “Pallas, dread sacker of cities” and
Kudides’ “A cry that echoes afar” were popular in
earlier times. No doubt there was plenty of variety
in accordance with the master’s taste. At the music
school, too, may have been taught the metrical version,
set to music, of the Athenian laws, which was ascribed
to Solon,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span>
and that of the legislation of Charondas,
which Athenian gentlemen sang over their wine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span>
Athenian boys were expected to know the laws by the
time that they were epheboi, and may well have been
taught them in this convenient and attractive way at
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
the lyre-master’s. To know how to play the lyre
became the mark of a liberal education, since every one
learned letters, but the poorest did not enter the music-school.
“He doesn’t know the way to play the lyre,”
became a proverb for an uneducated person, who had
not had so many opportunities in life as his wealthier
fellow-citizens. So, as a plea for a defendant we find&mdash;</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fifth century the Hellenes
were stimulated, according to Aristotle,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
by their growing
wealth and importance to make many educational
experiments, especially in music. All manner of musical
instruments were tried in the music-schools, but were
rejected on trial, when the moral effects could be better
appreciated. Among the instruments thus found
wanting was the flute. At one time the flute became
so popular at Athens that the majority of the free
citizens could play it. But its moral effect proved to
be unsatisfactory; it was the instrument which belonged
to wild religious orgies, and it aroused that hysterical
and almost lunatic excitement<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span>
which the Hellenes
regarded as a useful medicine, when taken at long
intervals of time, for giving an outlet to such feelings
and working them off the system, in order that a long
period of calm might follow. But such a medicine was
most unsuitable to be the daily food of boys. The
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
flute had two other disadvantages. It distorted the
face sufficiently to horrify a sensitive Hellene.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
It also
prevented the use of the voice: the boys could not
sing to it, as they sang to the lyre. So Athena, in the
old legend, had been quite right in throwing the
instrument away in disgust: it was only suitable for a
Phrygian Satyr, for it made no appeal to the intellect,
but only to the passions.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This is Aristotle’s account. It may be objected
that the vases which represent scenes in the music-schools
show the flute and the lyre being taught side
by side, and apparently equally popular. But these
vases can mostly be traced more or less certainly to
the first half of the fifth century, and so they bear out
Aristotle’s statement. Moreover, the flute did not, of
course, die out in Hellas by any means; it only became
an extra, instead of the regular instrument in schools.
The most notable Athenians, Kallias and Kritias and
Alkibiades, are said to have played it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span>
It always
remained popular at Thebes. But at Athens, in the
banquets, while the guests usually played the lyre
themselves, the flute was as a rule only played by
professional flute-girls,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span>
although on the vases the guests
are sometimes found performing on this instrument
also.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>
Probably the Athenian attitude may be summed
up in the “ancient proverb”:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
It was usual to play on two flutes at the same time.
Such a pair has been found,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_308" id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span>
together with a lyre, in a
tomb at Athens. The flutes are somewhat over a foot
in length, and have five holes on the upper and one
on the lower side. Each has a separate mouthpiece.
Besides this, flute-players sometimes wore a sort of
leathern muzzle<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span>
over their mouths; but this does not
appear in the schools. The pair of flutes were carried
in a double case, made of some spotted skin; it had a
pocket on one side, to hold the mouthpieces,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_310" id="fnanchor_310"></a><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span>
and a
cord attached by which it could be hung up when not
in use. The two flutes seem to have corresponded to
treble and bass, “male” and “female” as Herodotos
calls them. The treble was on the right, the bass on
the left.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_311" id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span>
Flutes could be set to different harmonies,
apparently by some rearrangement of stops. In the
case of the flute, as in the case of the lyre, individual
tuition was the rule. First the master played an air,
and then the boy had to repeat it, while the master
criticised.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_312" id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span>
Or the master played the air on a barbitos
and sang to it, while the pupil accompanied him on the
flute. This method had two advantages. The master
was able to play at the same time as the boy, and give
him instruction while playing, which the flute prevented
him from doing. The song, too, which he was enabled
to sing obviated one of the chief disadvantages of the
flute: for the Hellenes objected to instrumental music
as meaningless, unless it was accompanied by words.</p>

<p>There seem to have been music-schools scattered
throughout Attica, besides those established in the
capital: the description of the village boys marching off
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
to the lyre-master’s in a snow-storm without overcoats
has already been quoted. The names of a few masters
are extant. Lampros taught Sophocles the poet.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_313" id="fnanchor_313"></a><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>
Sokrates<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span>
recommends Nikias to send his son to the
famous Damon, who “is not merely a first-class musician,
but also just the man to be with boys like this.” But
whether these musicians kept regular schools cannot be
ascertained. Sokrates himself in his later years attended
the music-school of Konnos, and learned among the
boys. “I am disgracing Konnos the music-master,”
he says, “who is still teaching me to play the lyre.
The boys who are my schoolfellows laugh at me and
call Konnos the ‘Greybeard teacher.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_315" id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span>
The same
Konnos adopted the common but iniquitous custom
of bestowing his chief attention on his more promising
pupils, while neglecting the backward.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span>
Aristophanes
caricatures Kleon’s school-days as follows: “The boys
who went to school with Kleon say he would often set
his lyre to the Dorian (= Gift-ian) harmony alone.
Finally, the lyre-master lost his temper and told the
paidagogos to take him away, saying, “This boy can’t
learn anything but the Briberian (Dorodokisti) mode.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_317" id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The attitude of the philosophers towards music will
be discussed elsewhere. Plato’s view may be summed
up in the words which he puts in the mouth of
Protagoras the Sophist.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_318" id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
 “The music-master makes
rhythm and harmony familiar to the souls of the boys,
and they become gentler and more refined, and having
more rhythm and harmony in them, they become more
efficient in speech and in action. The whole life of Man
stands in need of good harmony and good rhythm.”
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
Aristotle’s attitude is briefly this. “Music is neither a
necessary nor a useful accomplishment in the sense in
which Letters are useful, but it provides a noble and
worthy means of occupying leisure-time.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_319" id="fnanchor_319"></a><a href="#footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></span>

<p>Aristotle mentions that in his day some added drawing
and painting to the three parts of the course.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_320" id="fnanchor_320"></a><a href="#footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span>
It
was not universal, like these, and it does not seem to
have started till the fourth century. In the <cite>Republic</cite>
and <cite>Laws</cite> Plato does not attack and criticise it among
the other educational subjects; but it plays so prominent
a part in the <cite>Republic</cite> that it is obvious that the
philosopher regarded it as a dangerous enemy to the
views which he wished to spread. It is noticeable that
the discussion of Art comes in as an after-thought, in
Book <abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr> May it not be inferred that when Plato
wrote the earlier books, drawing and painting were not
yet in vogue in the schools, but they became popular
before he had finished his great work?</p>

<p>In Periclean Athens the possibilities of artistic training
had certainly existed. In the <cite>Protagoras</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_321" id="fnanchor_321"></a><a href="#footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></span>
as an
instance in some argument, it is suggested that the
lad Hippokrates might “go to this young fellow who
has been in Athens of late, Zeuxippos of Heraklea.
Every day that he was with him he would improve as
an artist.” Earlier in the same dialogue Sokrates
remarks that his friend might go to Polukleitos or
Pheidias, and pay to be taught sculpture.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_322" id="fnanchor_322"></a><a href="#footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></span>
The large
numbers of boys who became apprentices to the potters
at Athens must have learned line-drawing and designing
and painting from the earliest times. But art probably
did not become a usual part of a liberal, as distinct from
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
a technical, education till the middle of the fourth
century.</p>

<p>This date is fixed by a passage in Pliny.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_323" id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span>
According
to him, its introduction was due to Pamphilos the
Macedonian. At his instance, first at Sikuon, where
he lived, and afterwards in the rest of Hellas, free boys
were taught before everything painting on boxwood,
and this art was included in the first rank of the liberal
arts. Now Pamphilos’ picture of the Herakleidai is
mentioned in the <cite>Ploutos</cite> of Aristophanes, which
appeared in 388 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Apelles, his pupil, began to
come into prominence about 350: Pamphilos himself
seems to have lived on till the close of the century.
The introduction of painting into the schools at Sikuon
may therefore be dated, roughly, about 360 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, and
from there the custom spread over Hellas. By 300
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> no doubt art had become a regular part of the
educational curriculum; for the philosopher Teles,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_324" id="fnanchor_324"></a><a href="#footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></span>
who probably lived about that time, mentions the
gymnastic trainer, the letter-master, the musician, and
the painter as the four chief burdens of boys. A
trace of the new art-schools, with their technical
vocabulary, is found in the <cite>Laws</cite>, the work of Plato’s
old age:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span>
 “paint in or shade off,” he says, “or whatever
the artists’ boys call it.”</p>

<p>Of the methods used in drawing and painting in
Hellas little trace is left. Polugnotos and his contemporaries
had produced idealised pictures, taking
points from many beautiful men and women and
uniting them to make one perfect man or woman.
When Idealism gave way to Realism in Hellas, the change
affected painting also. The artists tried to create a real
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
illusion in their works, taking subjects like chairs or
tables and making the spectator believe them to be real.
They were helped by the developments of perspective
and foreshortening, which were discovered at this time.
It is against this exaggerated realism and the choice
of homely subjects that Plato’s attack is directed: he
hates such illusions as shams.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span>
In the diatribes of the
<cite>Republic</cite> the possibility of idealised painting seems
to be forgotten. Whether the boys in the art-schools
also suffered by this change and were condemned to
draw chairs and tables only cannot be decided.</p>

<p>The pupils, of course, did not have paper to draw
and paint upon, nor was canvas employed. Ordinarily
they used white wood, boxwood for preference, owing
to its smoothness. Lead or charcoal would serve for
drawing; for erasures, instead of india-rubber a sponge
was used.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span>
They may, perhaps, have practised on their
wax tablets. One process was <ins title="skiagraphia">σκιαγραφία</ins> “shadow-drawing,”
which produced rough sketches in light and
shade: these seem to have been only intelligible when
considered from a distance. Plato regarded them with
distrust, as a sort of conjuring.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_328" id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In ordinary painting, which might be either watercolour
or encaustic,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_329" id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span>
the first thing was to sketch in the
outline (<ins title="hypographein, perigraphê">ὑπογράφειν, περιγραφή</ins>); the artist then filled
in (<ins title="apergazesthai">ἀπεργάζεσθαι</ins>) the picture with his colours, with
perpetual glances, now to the original, now to the copy,
mixing his paints the while. Beginners would, no doubt,
rub out (<ins title="exaleiphein">ἐξαλείφειν</ins>) frequently, and paint in again.</p>

<p><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
Aristotle,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_330" id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></span>
in discussing artistic education, notices
that it gave boys a good eye for appreciating art, and
enabled them to exercise good taste in buying furniture,
pottery, and other household requisites, which, to judge
from the scanty relics, must have been masterpieces of
beauty in the house of a cultivated Athenian. But still
more important, it gave them “an eye for bodily
beauty”:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_331" id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span>
which suggests that the human form,
especially its proportions, formed the chief study of the
art-schools. Proportion was the essence of Hellenic
art; the great sculptors, as is well known, spent much
time in drawing up a canon of perfect proportions for
the human body. The boys may well have used their
companions in the palaistrai for models, and the
canons of physical proportion which they were taught
by the art-master would serve to stimulate them with
a desire to attain to such a perfection of body by
their own athletic exercises.</p>

An abacus of a very similar sort is still in use in China and Japan, even in

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">ATHENS AND THE REST OF HELLAS:<br />
PHYSICAL EDUCATION</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">It</span> is well known that the Hellenes attached an
enormous importance to physical exercise. This was
partly, no doubt, due to their intense appreciation of
bodily beauty, which it was the endeavour of their
gymnastic training to produce. But it must be
remembered that to be in “good condition” was
essential to them. Any morning an Hellenic citizen
might find himself called upon to take the field against
an invader, or might be despatched to ravage an
enemy’s territory. Only the most cogent excuses
were accepted. Plato<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_332" id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span>
has left a vivid picture of a
rich man, who has lived in idleness and luxury, suddenly
called out to serve his country. Unhappy Dives
marches along panting and perspiring, he is ill on
board ship, and in battle when he has to charge or
fight vigorously, he has no wind and is in a state of
hopeless misery; while his poorer or wiser companions,
who are “lean and wiry, and have lived in the open
air,” mock at him and despise him. Sokrates points
out to young Epigenes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span>
who has neglected his physical
condition, what risks he runs. In battle, when a
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
retreat is sounded, he will be left behind by his
companions, and be either killed or taken prisoner by
the foe; and the lot of the captive was frequently
slavery for life, unless his friends ransomed him. But
there were also intellectual and moral risks. “Bodily
debility,” says Sokrates, “frequently causes a loss of
memory, and low spirits, and a peevish temper, and
even madness, to invade a man, so as to make even
intellectual pursuits impossible.” To be a good citizen
and to be a good thinker a man must always be in good
physical condition. It became a duty to oneself and to
the State “to live in the open air and accustom oneself
to manly toils and sweat, avoiding the shade and
unmanly ways of life.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_334" id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span>
By divine ordinance, “Sweat
was the doorstep of manly virtue,” as old Hesiod had
sung.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_335" id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This addiction to gymnastic exercises of all kinds
was characteristic of the Hellenic peoples from the
days of Homer. The original object had been
symmetrical development of the body, health, speed,
strength, and agility. But, as the Egyptian sage
remarked, the Hellenes were a nation of children&mdash;it is
just that which gives to them their charm and interest&mdash;and
children usually and naturally care most for the
body. Consequently athletics were carried too far:
they became an end in themselves, instead of being
merely a means of attaining physical activity and health.
The professional athlete became a sort of spoilt child,
fed at public expense,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span>
courted by crowds of admirers,
and all the time he was quite useless for everything
except his own particular sort of contest, boxing or
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
wrestling or the like. The tendency was ruinous: the
Hellenes preferred to be good gymnasts rather than
good soldiers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_337" id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span>
The competitor, boy or man, who
entered for one of the great prizes had to live in
complete idleness from other pursuits.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_338" id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span>
Such professionals
“slept all the day long, and if they departed
from their prescribed system of training in the very
slightest degree, they were seized with serious diseases.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span>
Consequently they were useless as soldiers, since in
war it is necessary to be wide awake, not torpid, and
to be able to stand vicissitudes of heat and cold, and
not to be made ill by changes of diet. Specialisation
even led to deformity. The long-distance runner
developed thick legs and narrow shoulders, the boxer
broad shoulders and thin legs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
It is to this specialisation
that Galen<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span>
attributes the decline in utility of
Hellenic athletics. Philostratos even notes that only
in the good old days was the health of athletes not
actually impaired by their exercises. In those times,
he says, they grew old late, and took part in eight or
nine Olympic contests&mdash;retained, that is, their efficiency
for thirty years or more; moreover, they were as good
soldiers as they were athletes. Later, these habits
changed, and athletes became averse to war, torpid,
effeminate, luxurious in their diet. The medical profession
took upon itself to advise them&mdash;a good thing
in its way, but unsuitable for athletes; for it told them
to sit still after meals before taking exercise, and
introduced them to elaborate cookery. Bribery also
<!--Blank Page-->

<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
came into vogue among the professionals; usurers began
to enter the training schools on purpose to lend them

<p>Critics of this exaggerated athleticism were not
wanting, even in the earliest times. The attack begins
with Xenophanes of Kolophon. In an elegiac poem
he writes: “If a man wins a victory at Olympia
… either by speed of foot or in the pentathlon,
or by wrestling, or competing in painful boxing,
or in the dread contest called the pankration, his
countrymen will look upon him with admiration, and
he will receive a front seat in the games, and eat his
dinners at the public cost, and be presented with some
gift that he will treasure. All this he will get, even if
he only win a horse race. Yet he is not as worthy as I;
for my wisdom is better than the strength of men and
steeds. Nay, this custom is foolish, and it is not right
to honour strength more than the excellence of wisdom.
Not by good boxing, not by the pentathlon, nor by
wrestling, nor yet by speed of foot, which is the most
honoured in the contests of all the feats of human
strength&mdash;not so would a city be well governed. Small
joy would it get from a victory at Olympia: such
things do not fatten the dark corners of a city.”</p>

<p>Pass straight from this to the works of Pindar, in
order to see whether Xenophanes’ attack was justified.
To Pindar the world holds nothing better than an
Olympian victory. Be the descendant of athletes and
be an athlete yourself&mdash;that is the summit of human
attainment and bliss. His gods are either athletes
themselves or founders of athletic contests. A man’s
true desires may usually be best traced in the conception
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
which he forms of the future state: Pindar’s portrait
of Elysium is characteristic. First the scenery, a
magnificent description in his best manner:</p>

<p class="unindent">And in this Paradise how are the shades of the departed

some in gymnasia, some in draughts.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span>
That is the
highest bliss conceivable, in Pindar’s opinion.</p>

<p>But Euripides did not agree with him. He denounces
the athletic life with much vigour.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_346" id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span>
 “Of
countless ills in Hellas, the race of athletes is quite the
worst.… They are slaves of their jaw and worshippers
of their belly.… In youth they go about in splendour,
the admiration of their city, but when bitter old age
comes upon them, they are cast aside like worn-out
coats. I blame the custom of the Hellenes, who gather
together to watch these men, honouring a useless
pleasure.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span>
Who ever helped his fatherland by winning
a crown for wrestling, or speed of foot, or flinging
the quoit, or giving a good blow on the jaw? Will
they fight the foe with quoits, or smite their fists
through shields? Garlands should be kept for the
wise and good, and for him who best rules the city by
his temperance and justice, or by his words drives away
evil deeds, preventing strife and sedition.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
In return for this, the athlete-loving populace, finding
their voice in the popular poet Aristophanes,
denounced Euripides and his Sophist friends for emptying
the gymnasia and making the boys desire only a
good tongue, instead of a sound body, turning them
into pale-faced, indoor pedants, fit for nothing but
jabbering nonsense. The attitude of the poet in the
<cite>Clouds</cite> and <cite>Frogs</cite> is just that of an average schoolboy
discussing a student.</p>

<p>Plato has already been quoted as an authority against
the athlete of his day. In the <cite>Laws</cite> he rejects every
kind of gymnastics which is not strictly conducive to
military efficiency, and, like the Spartans, condemns the
pankration and boxing. Races in the ideal State are to
be run in full armour, and the javelin and spear are to
replace the quoit. It is exactly the position of some
moderns, who would substitute shooting and field-days
for cricket and football. The case against the athletes
may be closed with Aristotle’s testimony: he also condemns
the specialisation of the trained professional.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_348" id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span>
</p>

<p>But these denunciations of athletes do not apply so
much to Athens as to the other States of Hellas. The
Athenian Agora was full of the statues of generals and
patriots, not, as was the usual custom, of athletes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span>
The author of the treatise on the Athenian constitution,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span>
writing in the early days of the Peloponnesian War,
notices that the democracy had driven gymnastics out
of fashion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span>
He writes as one of the aristocrats who,
like Pindar and his princely friends, cared mainly for
the body and the outward beauties of life: the democracy
was vulgar, for it could not spend all its time in bodily
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
exercises and musical banquets. No doubt at that
period in Athens, as can be seen in Aristophanes, there
was a reaction in favour of intellectual pursuits against
the exclusive athleticism of the preceding age: the time
of the citizens in a great democracy was also largely
monopolised by State duties, whether in the Assembly
or in the Law Courts or in fighting by sea or land.
But athletics still remained quite sufficiently popular
even at Athens, and athletic “shop” remained one of
the chief topics of conversation at a dinner-party.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Gymnastic exercises centred round two sorts of
buildings which are often confused, the “gymnasium”
and the “palaistra.” The former may be said to
correspond to the whole series of fields and buildings
intended for games, which surround a modern public
school, including football and cricket grounds, running
track and jumping pit, fives courts, and so forth. The
“palaistra” often resembled little more than the playground
of a village school: it only demanded a sandy
floor, and sufficient privacy to protect the exercises from
intrusion: such buildings could be run up at private
expense in the smallest villages, and were often attached
to private houses. A “gymnasium,” on the other
hand, must have cost a vast sum to erect: even a great
capital like Athens only possessed three in the fourth
century; small towns must have been unable to afford
them at all. But the gymnasia were public buildings,
open to all; they were always full of citizens of all
ages, practising or watching others practise; they were
a fashionable place of resort, where Sophists lectured in
the big halls, and philosophers taught in the shady
gardens. For the trainer who wished to instruct his
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
class of boys they were wholly unsuitable; besides, any
casual stranger could stand by and get a lesson for
nothing. Consequently, even at Athens, the boys were
taught in palaistrai which could be closed to the
public:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span>
in the towns and villages there was no other
place.</p>

<p>It is quite true that boys went to the gymnasia.
Aristophanes<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span>
talks of “a nice little boy on his way
home from the gymnasium.” In Antiphon,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_355" id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
some
older boys are practising the javelin in a gymnasium;
a younger boy, who had been standing among the
spectators, being called by his paidotribes, runs across the
course and is killed. If the reading “paidotribes,” for
which K. F. Hermann would substitute “paidagogos,” is
correct, we find a paidotribes and his class of younger
boys present in a gymnasium, probably to practise
javelin-throwing, which must have demanded a larger
space than the palaistra often afforded. The elder boys
are probably not under his tuition, for they are using
real javelins, not the unpointed shafts which were
employed at school. Paidotribai with small palaistrai
may often have taken their classes to the free public
gymnasia to practise the diskos, the javelin, and running,
which required a large space. But none the less the
palaistra was the usual scene of the teaching of boys.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_356" id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span>
It must not, however, be supposed that a palaistra
was always reserved for boys. The “many palaistrai,”
which the democracy built for itself,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_357" id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span>
were doubtless
as much public buildings, open to all ages, as the
Akademeia or Lukeion. The palaistrai owned or
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
hired by private teachers must have been open to adults
when the boys were not present; that which is the
scene of the <cite>Lusis</cite> was apparently attended by two
classes, one of boys and the other of youths, who only
met there on festival days. In the palaistra of Taureas,
however, mentioned in the <cite>Charmides</cite>, the different
classes seem all to meet in the undressing-room; but
on that occasion the building may have been open for
general practice, not for teaching. Some such arrangement
into classes must have taken place in the village
palaistrai.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_358" id="fnanchor_358"></a><a href="#footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></span>
The master who taught the boys in the
palaistra was called the paidotribes, “boy-rubber”:
he must have owed his name to the great part which
rubbing, whether with oil or with various sorts of dust,
played in athletics.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_359" id="fnanchor_359"></a><a href="#footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span>
He was expected to be scientific.
He had to know what exercises would suit what constitutions:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_360" id="fnanchor_360"></a><a href="#footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span>
he is often coupled with the doctor.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_361" id="fnanchor_361"></a><a href="#footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span>
His
object was to prevent, the doctor’s to cure, diseases.
He even prescribed diet. Besides health, he was
expected to aim at beauty and strength.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_362" id="fnanchor_362"></a><a href="#footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span>
His training,
in Plato’s opinion, also served to produce firmness of
character and strength of will: he must therefore know
how much training to administer to each boy, for too
much would cause excess of these qualities and lead
to savage brutality, and too little would result in
effeminacy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_363" id="fnanchor_363"></a><a href="#footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
Since so much science was demanded of the paidotribes,
parents exercised much forethought in choosing
a gymnastic school for their boys:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_364" id="fnanchor_364"></a><a href="#footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span>
they would “call
upon their friends and relations to give advice, and
deliberate for many days,” in order to find a trainer
whose instructions would “make their son’s body a
useful servant to his mind, not likely by its bad
condition to compel him to shirk his duty in war or
elsewhere.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_365" id="fnanchor_365"></a><a href="#footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span>
This at Athens, no doubt: in the smaller
towns and villages there could have been little choice:
parents must have taken what they could get.</p>

<p>On arriving at the chosen palaistra with his paidagogos
the boy would find a class assembling. He
would first go into the undressing-room<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_366" id="fnanchor_366"></a><a href="#footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
and strip.
For all the exercises were performed naked. This no
doubt gave the trainer a good opportunity of watching
which muscles most required development, and what
constitutional weaknesses, if any, must be treated circumspectly.
Passing into the palaistra proper, the boy
would find an enclosure surrounded, in the case of the
more expensive schools, with pillars. There would be
no roof. Hellenic custom maintained that it was
healthy to expose the naked body to the open air and
the mid-day sun: a white skin was regarded as a sign
of effeminacy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_367" id="fnanchor_367"></a><a href="#footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>
If the sun became dangerously hot,
little caps were worn, which at other times hung on the
walls of the palaistra. The floor was sand. Before
wrestling or practising the pankration or jumping,
the boys had to break up the soil with pickaxes<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_368" id="fnanchor_368"></a><a href="#footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span>
in order to make it soft: these pickaxes were
also suspended on the walls. Beside them would
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
be also <em>kôrukoi</em> or punch-balls, <em>haltêres</em> (a sort of
dumb-bell, used for jumping and other exercises),
the scrapers with which the dirt and sweat were
removed, bags to hold the cords which were used
as boxing-gloves, and spare javelins. Grown-up men
were not allowed to enter during the lessons, but could
apparently, if they wished, watch “from outside,” that
is, probably, from the dressing-room, where we often
find Sokrates conversing with the pupils, boys and
lads: he could not, probably, penetrate further.</p>

<p>The symbol of office which marked the paidotribes
was a long forked stick depicted in the vases.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_369" id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span>
This was
probably derived from the branch which the umpires at
the games held in their hands. The two symbols are
so much alike when represented on the vases<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_370" id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span>
that it is
often hard to distinguish them. There were generally
several under-masters in the palaistra. The more proficient
boys also were employed in teaching backward
schoolfellows; these “pupil-teachers” appear on vases,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_371" id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span>
holding the stick of office like the grown-up masters.
No doubt, poor boys managed to get instruction in this
manner from their richer friends in the public gymnasia
and palaistrai, without attending a school at all.</p>

<p>The staff of a palaistra also included professional
flute-players, for most of the exercises<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_372" id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span>
were performed
to the sound of a flute, in order that good time might
be preserved in the various movements. The player
in these cases wore the <ins title="phorbeia">φορβεία</ins> or mouth-band.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_373" id="fnanchor_373"></a><a href="#footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span>
</p>

<p>As I have pointed out in Chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, although the
literary authorities make gymnastic training of a sort
<!--Blank Page-->
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
begin with the seventh year, it is not at all probable
that the more recognised exercises, such as boxing and
wrestling, began till a good many years later. The
vases suggest that these subjects were taught some years
after letters and music had begun, for they represent
only older boys as learning them. Aristotle seems to
vouch for a graduated course of gymnastic exercises
during boyhood.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_374" id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span>

<p>What did the boys learn at the palaistra in the
meantime? Deportment and easy exercises. A passage
in Aristophanes informs us that they were taught the
most graceful way to sit down and get up.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_375" id="fnanchor_375"></a><a href="#footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span>
Vases
represent boys learning how to stand straight. There
were also all sorts of exercises in which the unpointed
javelin played the part of a training-rod and the
halteres the part of dumb-bells. The paidotribes might
also try to strengthen particular muscles in particular
boys. In an epigram,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_376" id="fnanchor_376"></a><a href="#footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></span>
a trainer is exercising a boy’s
middle by bending him over his knee, and then, while
holding his feet fast, swinging him over backwards.</p>

<p>No doubt what was known as “gesticulation” (<ins title="to
cheironomein">τὸ χειρονομεῖν</ins>) played a large part in this earlier training.
“Gesticulation” meant a scientific series of gestures and
movements of all the limbs, somewhat like the modern
systems of physical education taught by Sandow and
others. It was chiefly an exercise for the arms, as the
name implies, but on a celebrated occasion Hippokleides
the Athenian stood on his head on a table and “gesticulated”
with his feet.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_377" id="fnanchor_377"></a><a href="#footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span>
The particular movements were
very carefully designed, and were all intended to be
beautiful and gentlemanly.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_378" id="fnanchor_378"></a><a href="#footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></span>
Gesticulation served as a
preparation for various dancing-systems, but was
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
distinct from dancing, for Charmides was able to gesticulate
but unable to dance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_379" id="fnanchor_379"></a><a href="#footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span>
It was also preparatory
to gymnastics, for it resembled the movements of a
boxer sparring at the air for lack of an opponent.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_380" id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span>
The halteres were possibly often employed, for they
played a part in many gymnastic exercises.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_381" id="fnanchor_381"></a><a href="#footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>
This
“gesticulation,” then, being a preliminary to gymnastics
and dancing, would be the natural thing for the small
boys to learn in the palaistra. Other early exercises
were rope-climbing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_382" id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span>
and a sort of leap-frog.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_383" id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span>
The
various kinds of ball-game,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_384" id="fnanchor_384"></a><a href="#footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span>
mostly designed to exercise
the body scientifically, may also have been employed.
Of the regular exercises of the palaistra, which I am
about to discuss, running and jumping would suit quite
small boys; the diskos and javelin could also be begun
at an early age, for smaller sizes were made for children.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>The age at which the recognised exercises were first
taught no doubt varied with individual taste and
physical capacity: no strict line can be drawn. These
exercises were wrestling, boxing, the pankration, jumping,
running, throwing the diskos and the javelin.

<span class="decoration">Wrestling</span> (<ins title="palê">πάλη</ins>) was probably regarded as the most
important of these subjects, for it gave its name to the
Palaistra. For this exercise the soil was broken up
with the pickaxe and watered: the bodies of the
combatants were oiled beforehand. By these means
the Hellenes prevented their boys from disfiguring their
bodies with bumps and bruises, and the slipperiness of
the ground and of the antagonist’s body made the
exercise more difficult and therefore more valuable.
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
Three throws were necessary for victory. There were
two sorts of wrestling. In one the victor had to throw
his antagonist without coming to the ground himself;
this was a matter of ingenious twists and turns somewhat
like the Japanese jiu-jitsu. In the other both
combatants rolled over and over on the ground: this
was less scientific. The leading paidotribai had their
own favourite systems of wrestling, with various
openings, as in chess, and various ways of meeting
them. “What style of wrestling did you learn at the
Palaistra?” Kleon asks the sausage-seller.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_385" id="fnanchor_385"></a><a href="#footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span>
When
two boys were set to wrestle in school, they were not
allowed to contend as they pleased with a view to
victory, but had to carry out the directions of the
paidotribes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_386" id="fnanchor_386"></a><a href="#footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
A fragment of a system of wrestling has
been unearthed at Oxurhunchos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_387" id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Suppose there are two boys, Charmides and Glaukon.
The paidotribes sets them to wrestle, while the rest
of the class watch. He holds a long forked stick in
his hand. Pointing with it to Charmides, he says,
“You put your right hand between his legs and grip
him.” Then to Glaukon, “Close your legs on it, and
thrust your left side against his side.” To Charmides,
“Throw him off with your left hand.” To Glaukon,
“Shift your ground, and engage.” Each group of
directions, or figure <ins title="schêma">σχῆμα</ins>, as it was called, closes
with the word “Engage” <ins title="plexon">πλέξον</ins>. At this point,
probably, the two boys were allowed to wrestle at will,
the result, however, being foreseen and inevitable owing
to the previous moves.</p>

<p>An epigram in the <cite>Anthology</cite> represents instruction
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
of this sort being given: the boy retorts in the middle,
“I can’t possibly do it, Diophantos; that’s not the
way boys wrestle.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_388" id="fnanchor_388"></a><a href="#footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span>
</p>

<p>But, to use a parallel given by Isokrates, a pupil is
not yet a complete orator, when he knows how to
create pathos, irony, and so forth, and has been taught
the parts of a speech: he has still to learn when and
where and in what order to employ these several
artifices. So with wrestling. A boy who knows his
“figures” is not yet a wrestler: he has got to learn
when is the right moment to employ each of them in
an actual contest with a real antagonist. “When the
paidotribes has taught his pupils the ‘figures’ invented
for bodily training and practised them and made them
perfect in these, he makes the boys go through their
exercises again and accustoms them to physical toil, and
compels them to string together one by one the figures
which they have learnt, that they may have a firmer
grasp of them and get a clearer comprehension of the
right occasions for using them: for it is impossible to
comprehend these in an exact science.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_389" id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span>
The boys
have to judge for themselves, in the heat of the
contest, which figure it will be expedient to use: the
trainer cannot fix that beforehand. But they will best
be able to judge, if by long practice they have
discovered which figures suit them best and which
prove fatal to a particular type of opponent.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">Boxing</span> was similarly taught by a series of “figures.”
The boys used the light gloves, consisting of strings
wound round the hands, not the heavy, metal-weighted
gloves which professional athletes wore. The <span class="decoration">pankration</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_390" id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
was a mixture of boxing and wrestling: the boys
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
usually wore similar gloves for this but left the fingers
unfastened, only the wrists and knuckles being protected:
sometimes they fought with bare hands. For
both these exercises it was usual to wear dogskin
caps, in order to protect the ears from injury. The
pankration seems to have been regarded as an unsatisfactory
game for boys: so it was excluded from both
Olympian and Pythian games till a comparatively
late date. For one thing, it was dangerous, and
the exercise was very severe. But in the palaistra,
carefully regulated by the paidotribes and stopped
when the fighting became dangerous, no doubt it was
harmless enough. Alkibiades, however, once succeeded
in biting an opponent who was pressing him hard, being
ready to do anything rather than be beaten. “You
bite like a girl, Alkibiades!” exclaimed the indignant
boy. “No, like a lion,” answered Alkibiades.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_400" id="fnanchor_400"></a><a href="#footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></span>

<p><span class="decoration">Running</span> needs no comment: the methods are much
the same in all ages. The chief distances for races in
Hellas were the Stadion or 200 yards,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_401" id="fnanchor_401"></a><a href="#footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></span>
the Diaulos or
quarter-mile, and the Long-distance race, which varied
from three-quarter mile to about three miles. The
race in armour was not taught to boys. Races were
often run over soft sand, where the runners sank in,
just as long-distance races in England often include a
ploughed field or two. The sand made running both
a more severe exercise (so that a shorter distance
sufficed) and also a better training for war.</p>

<p>For the <span class="decoration">long jump</span> the Hellenes used the “halteres”
or light dumb-bells, to assist their momentum.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_402" id="fnanchor_402"></a><a href="#footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></span>
Even
in competitions, a flute-player stood by, to give the
competitors the assistance of his music: no doubt it
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
helped them to manage their steps so as to “take off”
on the right spot. They alighted into a large sandy
pit, dug up by the ever-present pickaxe: the jump
was only measured if they came down on to this evenly,
leaving a clear trace of their foot.</p>

<p>The <span class="decoration">diskos</span> was a flat circle of polished bronze or
other metal.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_403" id="fnanchor_403"></a><a href="#footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></span>
The specimen in the British Museum is
between 8 and 9 inches in diameter, and is inscribed
with athletic pictures on either side. It was flung with
either hand. A great many attitudes were necessary
before the diskos was launched, and every muscle of
the body must have been well exercised in the process.
The time was given, in the palaistra, by a flute-player.
In competitions both the distance and the direction of
the throw were taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Boys learnt to throw the <span class="decoration">javelin and spear</span> by
practising with long unpointed rods, which were also
used for a variety of physical exercises. The mark
seems to have been a sort of croquet-hoop or pair of
compasses, fixed into the ground: other targets were
also employed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_404" id="fnanchor_404"></a><a href="#footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></span>
The vases which represent this pursuit
often show the paidotribes carrying this hoop or fixing
it into the ground. It was planted at a fixed distance
which was stepped out.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, before we leave the “paidotribes,”
that his fee for his whole course seems to
have been a <ins title="mna">μνᾶ</ins>, about £4:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_405" id="fnanchor_405"></a><a href="#footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></span>
this enabled the pupil
to attend his lectures “for ever,” that is, perhaps till
the course was finished. Or perhaps this sum made a
pupil a life-member of a particular private palaistra.</p>

<p>Let us now look into one of the gymnasia at
Athens, the Akademeia or Lukeion. We will suppose
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
that it is late in the afternoon, for this was a favourite
time for taking exercise: the Athenians liked to get a
good appetite for their evening meal. Outside, a
troop of young men who intend to be enrolled in the
State-cavalry are practising their evolutions, mounting,
in the absence of stirrups, by a leaping-pole, and charging
in squadrons. On another side a body of heavy
infantry with spear and shield are assembling for a
night march into the Megarid;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_406" id="fnanchor_406"></a><a href="#footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></span>
they are packing
their supplies, onions and dried fish, perhaps, into their
knapsacks as they fall in, and are grumbling at having
to leave Athens just when a festival is coming; a burly
countryman is complaining to his general that it is not
his turn to serve, as he took part in the raid into
Boiotia last week, and his general is threatening him
with a prosecution for insubordination if he becomes
abusive. After paying our respects to the patron
deities, Herakles and Hermes and Eros,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_407" id="fnanchor_407"></a><a href="#footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></span>
and having
muttered a curse on all tyrants suggested by the statue
of Eros which Charmos the father-in-law of Hippias
the Peisistratid set up,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_408" id="fnanchor_408"></a><a href="#footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></span>
we enter the gymnasium.</p>

<p>The first room which we come to is the undressing-room.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_409" id="fnanchor_409"></a><a href="#footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></span>
On the benches round the walls a row of men
are sitting discussing the exact nature of Self-control:
an extremely ugly person, to whom they all pay great
respect, is stating that it is an exact science, and, if only
they can discover this science, the whole world will
become virtuous. Lads and men are stripping all
about the room, and passing off to take their exercises
elsewhere; others keep coming in and dressing and
listening to the discussion for a minute or two. A
handsome young fellow comes in: the ugly man makes
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
room for him with great energy, and his friends who
are sitting at the end of the bench are pushed off
suddenly on to the floor. A shout of laughter,
mingled with some strong Attic abuse, arises. Not
wishing to be involved as witnesses in an interminable
lawsuit, we hurry out through the further door into a
great cloister.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_410" id="fnanchor_410"></a><a href="#footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></span>
In the centre of this is a large open
space, with no roof. Here we meet a well-known
mathematician from Kurene,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_411" id="fnanchor_411"></a><a href="#footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></span>
who is walking round the
cloister with a crowd of pupils: he is explaining to
them that famous theorem about right-angled triangles,
whose proof is so neat that Pythagoras the vegetarian
sacrificed a hundred oxen when he discovered it. At
intervals the mathematician stops and draws a diagram
in the dust with his stick. As we follow him, we can
look into the rooms which surround the cloister. In
one, a crowd of men are anointing themselves with oil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_412" id="fnanchor_412"></a><a href="#footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></span>
The rubbing, which is so good for all bodily ills, and
the oil, even if not followed by any further exercise, are
regarded as an excellent thing. An Athenian gentleman
is expected to carry about a certain fragrance of this
oil,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_413" id="fnanchor_413"></a><a href="#footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></span>
and his skin must always be sleek with it; but as
a rule the anointing is a prelude to exercise, and is
meant to make the joints supple and the body slippery
enough to elude a wrestler’s grip.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_414" id="fnanchor_414"></a><a href="#footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></span>
A slave or an
attendant stands by many of the men, holding one of
those dainty oil-flasks which make so great a feature in
modern Museums of Archæology. Through the next
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
door we see the “dusting-room.” Various sorts of
dust were used for rubbing the body. They served
to clean it of sweat after exercise, to open the pores, to
warm it when cold, and to soften the skin. A yellow
dust was particularly popular; for it made the body
glisten so as to be pleasant to look at, as a good body
in good condition ought to be.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_415" id="fnanchor_415"></a><a href="#footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></span>
Next perhaps will be
the bathing-room&mdash;a popular place in the evening, for
it was usual to take a bath before dinner.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_416" id="fnanchor_416"></a><a href="#footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></span>
The
bathers either splash themselves out of great bowls
which stand upon pedestals, or receive a shower bath
by getting a companion or an attendant to pour a
pitcher of water over them. Tanks capable of receiving
the whole body at once were not usual, though
known to Homer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_417" id="fnanchor_417"></a><a href="#footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></span>
Then we see the room of the
<span class="decoration">korukos</span>, or punch-ball, which will present a very curious
appearance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_418" id="fnanchor_418"></a><a href="#footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></span>
The <span class="decoration">korukos</span> is a large sack hanging
from the ceiling by a rope. The lighter <span class="decoration">korukoi</span> are
filled with fig seeds or meal, the heavier with sand.
They hang at about the height of a man’s waist. You
push one of them gently at first, and more and more
violently as you gain experience; having pushed it,
you plant yourself in the way of the rebound, and try
to stop the sack with your hands or your chest or your
back or your head. If you are not strong enough, you
will be knocked over, and the room will laugh. This
will practise you in standing steady, and make all parts
of your body firm and muscular. The <span class="decoration">korukos</span> can
also be used as a punch-ball, to strengthen the boxer’s
arms and shoulders. This exercise is especially recommended
for boxers and pankratiasts: the latter
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
ought to use the heavier variety. Perhaps there will
also be some lay-figures hanging up round the walls,
for these also were used for practising. Here, too,
some unlucky individuals who, from unpopularity or
other causes, are unable to find an antagonist, will be
exercising their fists on thin air. But both these
expedients were regarded as ridiculous.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_419" id="fnanchor_419"></a><a href="#footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></span>
</p>

<p>There were a large number of other rooms round
the cloister, some intended for exercises in wet weather,
for, if possible, exercise was always taken out of doors;
for it was regarded as a great object to make the skin
brown and hard by exposure to the sun. So King
Agesilaos put his Asiatic captives up for sale in his
camp naked, in order that his Hellenic soldiers, seeing
their pale, soft flesh, unused to exposure, might despise
their enemy. But as most of these rooms were furnished
with seats, they were largely used as lecture-halls
by wandering Sophists,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_420" id="fnanchor_420"></a><a href="#footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></span>
who gave free lectures in
them to any passer-by who might care to listen, in
order to attract regular, paying pupils. So we can
take our pick and hear lectures on poetry or metaphysics,
music or rhetoric, geography or history, at our
pleasure.</p>

<p>After this, we can turn our attention to the
great central courtyard,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_421" id="fnanchor_421"></a><a href="#footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></span>
which is surrounded by the
cloister, or to the racecourse and open spaces which
lie beyond it. In one part will be the wrestling
arena.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_422" id="fnanchor_422"></a><a href="#footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></span>
Pairs of oiled, naked combatants will be
struggling together, amid a crowd of cheering spectators,
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
and perhaps the trainer will be standing by,
giving them directions. One group attracts especial
attention: for the pair are going to represent Athens
at Olympia next year. Elsewhere the pankratiasts are
contending, some sparring at arm’s length, others
joined in a deadly grapple, rolling over and over on
the ground and pummelling one another’s heads with
their gloved knuckles. They are covered with clotted
dust and oil and will need much scraping. Then there
are the boxers, bearing either the light gloves, or, if
they intend to take part in a big competition, the
heavy iron balls padded over with leather which were
used in the great Games.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_423" id="fnanchor_423"></a><a href="#footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></span>
There are races too in
progress, lap by lap round the great Stadion. Some of
the runners are naked, others are wearing helmet and
shield, since they are practising for the Race in Armour.
Friends run beside them for a little way, pacing them
and encouraging them. Others are jumping, with the
halteres in their hands, into the pit, while their friends
mark the point where their heels have left a mark in
the sand. A professional flute-player, with his mouth-band
on, sets the time. Each is, no doubt, hoping
to beat Phaüllos’ great jump of 55 feet&mdash;the world’s
record. Everywhere are crowds of spectators,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_424" id="fnanchor_424"></a><a href="#footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></span>
and
everywhere eager trainers giving advice, hoping, if their
pupil gains a prize at some great Games, to make a
name for themselves, and attract a crowd of lads to
their paid lessons: perhaps they will even be immortalised
by some contemporary Pindar in a song in honour
of their pupil’s victory.</p>

<p>In another corner, it may be, there will be teams
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
practising together. A regiment of epheboi may be
undergoing their gymnastic training before service
on the frontier:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_425" id="fnanchor_425"></a><a href="#footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></span>
or a team of them may be training,
watched by the rich “gumnasiarchos,” for the
torch-race at the festival of Hephaistos, or for the
race from the Temple of Dionusos to that of Athena
of the Sunshades, where the winner will receive a large
bowl containing wine and honey and cheese and meat
and olive oil&mdash;not all mixed together, let us hope.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_426" id="fnanchor_426"></a><a href="#footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></span>
There may also be teams practising wrestling and other
bodily exercises together. Their trainer, “thinking it
impossible to lay down separate regulations for each
individual, orders roughly what suits the majority. So
every one of the team takes an equal amount of exercise,
and they all start and all stop running, or wrestling, or
whatever it may be, at the same moment.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_427" id="fnanchor_427"></a><a href="#footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the larger open spaces we shall find Athenians
throwing the diskos, like Muron’s celebrated figure, or
practising archery, or flinging the spear or javelin.
In watching these care must be exercised: unwary spectators
may be killed or injured. Mythology is full of
unfortunates killed in this way. Was not the fair
Huakinthos slain by Apollo’s quoit? Antiphon, too,
in his new book on speech-writing, takes as one of his
themes a boy killed by a comrade’s javelin accidentally.
We can also take a lesson in the use of spear and shield
from the teacher of arms: a pair of Sophists, who
specialise in this subject, have just come to Athens, and
will doubtless be exhibiting their skill here. We remember,
though, that the warlike Spartans ridicule these
professors, and General Laches regards them as quite
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
useless for military purposes, as we heard him telling
Sokrates the other day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_428" id="fnanchor_428"></a><a href="#footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></span>
So we will pass on.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people in the gymnasium
confine themselves to walking about. The colonnades
and the gardens are convenient and attractive, and
there is plenty to watch everywhere. The “xustos,”
or covered cloister,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_429" id="fnanchor_429"></a><a href="#footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></span>
where athletes exercise in bad
weather, is particularly popular among the walkers.
And while they walk, they talk. There is a group of
philosophical students arguing about the Supreme Good
or constructing an ideal State. There is a party of
inquirers who are discussing the nature of plants, or
the varieties of crustaceans. Yonder, a half-naked,
unkempt enthusiast is declaiming against luxury.
“Man,” he cries, “is independent of circumstances.”
Everywhere, walkers and spectators and talkers, but
walkers above all.</p>

<p>For the average Athenian spent all his time upon
his legs: to sit down was the mark of a slave.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_430" id="fnanchor_430"></a><a href="#footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span>
He
walked nearly all day: the distance which he covered
in five or six days would easily stretch from Athens to
Olympia. He took a walk before breakfast, another
before lunch, another before dinner, and another between
dinner and bed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_431" id="fnanchor_431"></a><a href="#footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Games of ball are going on in the ball-court yonder.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_432" id="fnanchor_432"></a><a href="#footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span>
We may remember that the poet Sophocles was a
famous player.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_433" id="fnanchor_433"></a><a href="#footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></span>
But the shadow on the great sun-dial
has nearly reached the ten-foot mark which announces
dinner-time to the Athenian world. The crowds who
have been exercising themselves are scraping off the
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
sweat and dirt with the <ins title="stlengis">στλεγγίς</ins> or scraper,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_434" id="fnanchor_434"></a><a href="#footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></span>
or else
hurrying to the bath-rooms. After the bath comes
another anointing, with oil and water this time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_435" id="fnanchor_435"></a><a href="#footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></span>
Then
away through the nearest gate into the city, while the
great buildings on the Akropolis grow misty in the
twilight and Athena’s guardian Spear catches the last
rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>All this was open to the poorest Athenian: there
was no fee for entrance. The only expenses were those
incurred in buying an oil-flask and scraper, which the
State did not as a rule provide, and any fees that might
be paid to a trainer for special “coaching.” The poor
could learn as much as they required from watching
those who were proficient. It was usual to tip the man
in the public baths who poured cold water over the
bathers and assisted them generally: but this probably
did not apply to the bath-rooms in the gymnasia. The
State certainly made it easy for every citizen to take as
much exercise as he pleased.</p>

<p>Women were wholly excluded from athletics at
Athens. In Sparta girls exercised themselves as much
as the boys. In other Dorian States feminine athletics
were encouraged to a less degree. At Argos there
were foot-races for girls. In Chios they could be seen
wrestling in the gymnasia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_436" id="fnanchor_436"></a><a href="#footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>But the gymnasia and palaistrai, though they provided
so many different kinds of exercises, did not
supply the Hellenes with their sole opportunities for
keeping the body in good condition. Hunting was a
popular employment at Sparta and no doubt elsewhere:
Xenophon, who was devoted to it, would have liked

where it languished,
perhaps from lack of game. Swimming and rowing
were usual accomplishments. Riding was compulsory
for rich citizens at Athens, for they had to serve in the
cavalry; it was also popular in Thessaly, the land of
horses. Military service provided both an incentive
to physical exercise and a frequent means of obtaining
it. Dancing was universal throughout the Hellenic
world and played a larger part in Hellenic education than
is usually recognised. At Sparta it was of paramount
importance. At Athens it was taught free to large
numbers of boys under the system of leitourgiai. Plato
divides physical education into dancing and wrestling.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_438" id="fnanchor_438"></a><a href="#footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></span>
Aristophanes<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_439" id="fnanchor_439"></a><a href="#footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></span>
brackets dancing between the palaistra
and music, when he wishes to give the three elements
of a gentleman’s education. Choral dancing to a
Hellene was at once the ritual of religion, the ordinary
accompaniment of a festival or public holiday, the
highest form of music, and the most perfect system of
physical exercise then discovered.</p>

<p>The modern reader finds it very hard to realise
why Hellenic philosophers attach so much educational
importance to the various kinds of dance. This is
because modern dancing differs from its ancient prototype
in two very important particulars: it is not
connected with religion and it is not dramatic. In the
East dancing was, and is, the language of religion.
David, to show his fervour, danced before the Ark
with all his might. In Hellas, dancing accompanied
every rite and every mystery.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_440" id="fnanchor_440"></a><a href="#footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span>
The choral dance
afforded the outlet to religious enthusiasm which elsewhere
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
is provided by services: any change in its
characteristics was a change in ritual and in the inexpressible
sentiments and moral attitudes which become
so closely bound up with habitual religious observances.
And, since it was the usual ritual of worship, dancing
became all-important in education, as providing the
forms through which the highest aspirations of the
children were accustomed to find expression.</p>

<p>The boy who danced in honour of Dionusos was
trying to assimilate himself to the god, whose history
and personality would be brought home to him vividly
by the vineyards around him: they would serve him for
a parable. The vine that came so mysteriously out of
the earth, lived its short life in the rain and sunshine,
and was crushed and killed at the harvest, to rise
again in the strange juice which thrilled him with such
wondrous power&mdash;there was plenty of parable for him
there. And while he felt the god’s history so vividly,
he was acting it, for acting was the very essence of
Hellenic dancing. He would act the sorrows of
Dionusos, his persecution from city to city, and his
final conquest; he would match each incident in the
story with suitable inward feelings and outward gestures
of sorrow and triumph. Thus his dancing came to
be a keenly religious observance, accompanied by more
vivid acting than is possible on a modern stage; such
dancing, it must be remembered, was the parent of Attic
Drama. The dramatic power of such acting became
enormous; one dancer, it is said, could make the whole
philosophic system of Pythagoras intelligible without
speaking a word, simply by his gestures and attitudes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_441" id="fnanchor_441"></a><a href="#footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In such dramatic dancing the subject or plot was
important. Here the weakness of the old Hellenic
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
mythology became fatal. For it was the old myths
that supplied the motives of religious dances as well
as of the drama, and many of them were morally
unsatisfactory. When a chorus of boys danced the
<cite>Birth-pangs of Semelé</cite>, the most famous dithyramb
of Timotheos, not unnaturally objections were raised.
The new school of musicians and poets, which arose
towards the end of the fifth century, tried to represent
everything and anything in the most realistic way
possible: their dancers had to imitate with voice and
gesture “blacksmiths at the forge, craftsmen at work,
sailors rowing and boatswains giving them orders,
horses neighing, bulls bellowing,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_442" id="fnanchor_442"></a><a href="#footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></span>
and so forth. They
chose the commonest and coarsest scenes, just like
Dutch painters. In their hands, dancing became something
vulgar, as well as morally risky, though still under
a semi-religious sanction. It is this charge which
justified Plato’s denunciations of the dramatic element
in poetry and music. It must be remembered that the
choregos at Athens, who collected the boys from his
tribe to dance these dithyrambs, could use compulsion
if fathers refused to allow their sons to join his chorus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_443" id="fnanchor_443"></a><a href="#footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></span>
Yet the advantages of learning to dance were great,
quite apart from the religious aspects. Dancing was a
scientifically designed system of physical training, which
exercised every part of the body symmetrically.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_444" id="fnanchor_444"></a><a href="#footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></span>
The
different masters invented systems of their own, just
as the paidotribai invented systems of wrestling; in
both cases the teaching began with a series of figures,
which were afterwards fitted together. Different
localities also had their own particular figures.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_445" id="fnanchor_445"></a><a href="#footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
The solo dance was used for private exercise. It
also made its way into the drama. Sometimes, too, in
the choral performances one or two of the best dancers
were singled out to perform more elaborate evolutions
expressing the dramatic course of the subject. But
the choral dance was universal throughout Hellas. Its
motives ranged from the solemn religious questionings
of Aeschylus to the drunken buffoonery of the vine-festivals.
The dance might be the act of worship of
a whole people, as in the great festivals at Delos. It
might, like the Gumnopaidia at Sparta, be designed to
exhibit the physical perfection and practise the military
evolutions of a nation in arms. It might celebrate
the triumphant return of an Olympian victor to his
native city, as did many of the dances which accompanied
the extant odes of Pindar. The chorus-songs
of Tragedy and Comedy were set to dances of a sort;
but from these last boys seem to have been excluded.</p>

<p>For educational purposes, besides the dithuramboi
already mentioned, the two most important classes were
the War-dance and the Naked-dance (<ins title="gymnopaidia">γυμνοπαιδία</ins>).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_446" id="fnanchor_446"></a><a href="#footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></span>
In the War-dance the performers, clad in arms, imitated
all the ways in which blows and spears might be avoided,
now bending to one side, now drawing back, now leaping
in the air, now crouching down: then, again, they
acted as though they were hurling javelins and spears
and dealing all manner of blows at close quarters.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_447" id="fnanchor_447"></a><a href="#footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></span>
The Kuretic dance in Crete was very similar; the
dancers “in full armour beat their swords against their
shields and leaped in an inspired and warlike manner.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_448" id="fnanchor_448"></a><a href="#footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></span>
The field-days, when teams of boys and “packs” of
epheboi fought one another to the sound of music, were
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
only a more warlike sort of dance. In fact, war and
the war-dance were as closely connected in Hellas as
war and drill in Modern Europe. The Thessalians
called their heroes “dancers”; Lucian quotes an
inscription that “the people set up this statue to
Eilation, who danced the battle well”: “chief dancer”
(<ins title="proorchêstêr">προορχηστήρ</ins>)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_449" id="fnanchor_449"></a><a href="#footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></span>
was a dignified title. The same author
observes that in warlike Sparta the young men learn
to dance as much as to fight, and that their military
and gymnastic exercises alike were inextricably mixed
up with dancing.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The “Naked-dance” was to gymnastics what the war-dance
was to war.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_450" id="fnanchor_450"></a><a href="#footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></span>
It represented the movements of
the palaistra set to music, accompanied by some singing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_451" id="fnanchor_451"></a><a href="#footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></span>
The style was solemn, like that of the <ins title="emmeleia">ἐμμέλεια</ins>, or
dance of Tragedy. It was performed in the main by
boys, as the name <ins title="gymnopaidia">γυμνοπαιδία</ins> implies; but grown men
also took part, as at Sparta, where practically the whole
male population danced it at once. Plato seems to
mean a similar type by his “peace-dance” (in the
<cite>Laws</cite>), which is to be a thanksgiving for past mercies
or a prayer for continued prosperity.</p>

<p>In the regular system of education at Athens, it
is true, the boys learned only to sing and play, not
to dance. But owing to the perpetual demand for
boys from each of the ten tribes to compete at the great
festivals in war-dances and dithyrambs, dancing must
have been a common accomplishment. These competitors
also attracted and encouraged a large number
of dancing-masters. Any boy who showed promise
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
as a dancer, or perhaps even as a singer only, would
be singled out by the agents who collected choroi for
the choregoi.</p>

<p>Some rich man, let us call him Tisias,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_452" id="fnanchor_452"></a><a href="#footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span>
has just
been appointed choregos of the Erechtheid tribe for
the war-dance of boys at the Panathenaic festival, or
a boy-chorus in dithyrambs at the Thargelia. After
drawing lots with the choregoi of other tribes, he gets
Pantakles assigned to him as his poet and music-master,
to teach the boys: he might, if he wished, hire at his
own expense extra dancing- and music-masters.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_453" id="fnanchor_453"></a><a href="#footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></span>
Tisias
then sends for Amunias, whom the Erechtheid tribe
have chosen to collect their choroi and keep an eye on
them while they are being trained. If Tisias bears a
bad name or is unpopular with his tribe, he and his
agent will have trouble in collecting the boys; for the
fathers will refuse to give them up, and there will be
fines imposed and securities taken, before the chorus
assembles. But as a rule the parents will accept gladly;
it is a chance of a free education for a month or so,
for Tisias will pay all expenses, even of meals, and the
State supplies the teacher; it is a chance, too, for the
boy to distinguish himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tisias will have provided a suitable
schoolroom, in his own house, if possible; rich men,
to whom the post of choregos was a frequent burden,
would keep an apartment for the purpose. If he
himself is busy, he will depute friends, who can be
trusted to swear in his favour before the Courts, to
watch the teaching; the agent will also be present.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_454" id="fnanchor_454"></a><a href="#footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></span>
For sometimes accidents occurred. Once a boy was
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
given a dose to drink, to improve his voice, and it
killed him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_455" id="fnanchor_455"></a><a href="#footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></span>
</p>

<p>When the day of the competition came, the chorus
would be suitably dressed at Tisias’ expense; he might
perhaps allow them gold crowns.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_456" id="fnanchor_456"></a><a href="#footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></span>
There might be
nine other choroi entering for the prize, but in the
time of Demosthenes this was not common. The
whole Athenian people and many foreigners would be
present at the contest, and it would be an anxious day
for choregos, boys, and parents. The State gave the
prizes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_457" id="fnanchor_457"></a><a href="#footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></span>
usually a tripod, which went to the winning
choregos, who would set it up in some public place
with an appropriate inscription, such as&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Oeneid tribe was victorious; a choros of boys. Eureimenes,
son of Meleteon, was choregos. Nikostratos taught.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_458" id="fnanchor_458"></a><a href="#footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">Or&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">Lusikrates, son of Lusitheides of Kikunna, was choregos.

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>We pass to the position which riding held in
Athenian education. The two richest classes in the
State were liable to service in the cavalry. They had to
supply their own horses, which were examined and, if
unfit, rejected; but the State paid them a sum of £8
annually for maintenance and arms in time of peace. As,
however, the number of the citizen cavalry never rose
above 1000, the whole of these two classes can never
have been so employed at once: the remainder served
in the heavy infantry. The two Hipparchoi elected for
the year, and their subordinates, the ten Phularchoi,
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
who each commanded a tribal contingent, on coming
into their office, would note how many of the thousand
who had served in the former year were no longer
liable to service owing to age, and would fill up the
vacancies; they would also make good those gaps
which occurred from time to time during their term of
office owing to wounds or death or sudden poverty.
To secure a recruit, they had only to go to some
rich and active young man who was not already
serving; if he refused to be enrolled, they could
prosecute him. The training often began before
eighteen, for Xenophon speaks of persuading the
recruit’s guardians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_460" id="fnanchor_460"></a><a href="#footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></span>
from whom he would be free at
that age. So Teles mentions the horse-breaker as
among the teachers of the lad in the secondary stage
of education. No doubt it took some training to
make an efficient cavalryman, and the Hipparchoi
liked to take the recruits young; but to keep a stud
was the favourite amusement of a rich young Athenian,
and many would learn to ride without any view to
military efficiency. As the Hellenes rode without
stirrups, mounting was one of the great difficulties of
the young rider, and figures chiefly on the vases.
Often they used the long cavalry-spear as a vaulting-pole.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_461" id="fnanchor_461"></a><a href="#footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></span>
Otherwise a groom or the master gave the
pupil a leg up: on a vase<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_462" id="fnanchor_462"></a><a href="#footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></span>
in the British Museum
the master is seen simply pushing the boy into his
seat. A comic poet,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_463" id="fnanchor_463"></a><a href="#footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></span>
who has left us a picture of
the young recruits learning to ride under the eye
of their Phularchoi, speaks only of mounting and
dismounting.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_464" id="fnanchor_464"></a><a href="#footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></span>
 “Go to the Agora,” says the speaker to
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
his slave, “to the Hermai, where the phularchoi keep
coming, and to the pretty disciples whom Pheidon is
teaching to mount their steeds and to get down again.”
Xenophon, among much sound advice to the young
rider about buying, training, and keeping his horse,
gives the Hipparchos the following <span class="lock">suggestions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Persuade the younger men to vault on to their
horses. It will be best if you supply the teacher for
this. The older men may be put up by some one else
in the Persian way. To practise the men in keeping
their seats over difficult country, frequent riding
expeditions are a good thing, but will be unpopular.
So tell your men to practise by themselves whenever
they are in the open country. But take them out
yourself occasionally and test them over all sorts of
ground. Give them sham fights in different kinds of
country. In order to make them keen about throwing
the javelin from horseback,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_465" id="fnanchor_465"></a><a href="#footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></span>
stir up rivalry between
the different squadrons and give prizes for this and for
good riding and the like. Above all make yourself
and your attendant gallopers as smart as possible.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_466" id="fnanchor_466"></a><a href="#footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></span>
</p>

<p>There were frequent reviews under the eyes of the
Boule. In the race-course at the Lukeion there was a
sham fight, each hipparchos commanding five squadrons
which pursued one another, and then charged front
to front, passing through the gaps in one another’s
lines. They had, also, to wheel in line. The review
was followed by javelin-throwing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_467" id="fnanchor_467"></a><a href="#footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></span>
Another review
was held at the Akademeia, on a course with a hard
soil (<ins title="ho epikrotos">ὁ ἐπίκροτος</ins>)&mdash;good practice for cavalry intending
to fight in rocky Attica. Here they had, among
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
other manœuvres, to charge at full gallop and suddenly
come to a halt.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_468" id="fnanchor_468"></a><a href="#footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></span>
</p>

<p>One of the attractions of the cavalry service was
the great Panathenaic procession, where the horsemen
played a leading part: an idealised picture of them
may be seen on the frieze of the Parthenon. Xenophon
gives a series of directions how to make the horses
prance and hold their heads up on this great occasion,
and suggests devices in gait which will attract popular
notice. This and kindred processions must have made
recruiting for the cavalry easy.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p><span class="decoration">Swimming</span> seems to have been, as would naturally
be expected, an exceedingly common accomplishment
in the maritime states of Hellas; even at inland Sparta
the boys must have learnt it for their daily plunge in
the Eurotas. According to tradition,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_469" id="fnanchor_469"></a><a href="#footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></span>
there was a law
at Athens that every boy should be taught reading,
writing, and swimming: the proverb for an utter dunce
was “he knows neither his letters nor how to swim.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_470" id="fnanchor_470"></a><a href="#footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></span>
Herodotos distinctly implies that all Hellenes knew
how to swim. “The Hellenic loss at Salamis,” he
says, “was small. For, as they knew how to swim
(as opposed to the barbarians who did not), when
their ships were destroyed, they swam over to the
island.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_471" id="fnanchor_471"></a><a href="#footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></span>
He takes it as a matter of course that every
sailor could swim. The whole crew of a captured
trireme during the Peloponnesian War as often as not
jumped overboard and escaped by swimming.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_472" id="fnanchor_472"></a><a href="#footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></span>
In
a story in Athenaeus the boys of Lasos, on coming out
of the wrestling-school, go off together for a bathe
and begin to dive. A friend of Aristippos used to
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
boast to him of his diving.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_473" id="fnanchor_473"></a><a href="#footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></span>
During the blockade
of Sphakteria by the Athenian fleet, numbers of
Helots swam over from the mainland to the island
under water.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_474" id="fnanchor_474"></a><a href="#footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></span>
Scanty and scrappy as they are, these
details show that swimming must have been taught
to most boys, at any rate if they were ever likely to
serve in a fleet. Plato twice<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_475" id="fnanchor_475"></a><a href="#footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></span>
uses a metaphor drawn
from a man swimming on his back, showing that this
method was known. When a young disputant is being
severely handled in a discussion, Sokrates intervenes,
“wishing to give the boy a rest, since he saw that he
was getting a severe ducking and he feared that he
might lose heart.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_476" id="fnanchor_476"></a><a href="#footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></span>
The phrase suggests that the sight
of boys learning to swim was familiar. They could
learn either in the innumerable creeks and bays of the
sea, or in the lakes and rivers, or in diving-pools.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_477" id="fnanchor_477"></a><a href="#footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></span>
There were also various “gymnastic games” which
young people played in the water together;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_478" id="fnanchor_478"></a><a href="#footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></span>
but of
their nature nothing is known.</p>

<p>It cannot reasonably be doubted that in the maritime
states a large proportion of the boys, at any rate of the
lower classes, were taught to <span class="decoration">row</span>, since each trireme
required a crew of 200, nearly all of whom had to use
the oar. In the good old days, according to the
<cite>Wasps</cite>, the main object was to be a good oar,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_479" id="fnanchor_479"></a><a href="#footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></span>
and
rowing-blisters were a sign of patriotism.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_480" id="fnanchor_480"></a><a href="#footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></span>
In an
emergency, the Athenians could make the whole citizen
force under a certain age embark on the fleet and could
win a victory with these rowers; this would have been
impossible if the average citizen had been ignorant of
rowing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_481" id="fnanchor_481"></a><a href="#footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></span>
On such occasions many even of the Hippeis
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
embarked: Aristophanes jestingly asserts that in an
expedition to Korinth the horses tried also, shouting,
“Gee-ho, put your backs into it. Do more work,
Dobbin.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_482" id="fnanchor_482"></a><a href="#footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></span>
Before the close of the war,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_483" id="fnanchor_483"></a><a href="#footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></span>
Charon, the
ferryman of Styx, assuming that every Hellene knows
the way to row, makes the souls of the departed row
themselves across. Boat-races were certainly known at
this period. A client of Lusias asserts that he has won
a race with a trireme off Cape Sounion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_484" id="fnanchor_484"></a><a href="#footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></span>
Probably the
trierarchoi, the rich men appointed to fit out the State
navy, either voluntarily or by regular custom, made the
ships race one another. Thus the races would be as
much inter-tribal contests as the dithyrambs or torch-races.
Two crews of the epheboi of a later date used

<p class="p2 center">EXCURSUS I</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> “gumnasiarchoi” have created some confusion among
those who have discussed Attic ways. Some authorities would
make them rich men performing a “leitourgia” and holding a
similar position to the trierarchoi and choregoi: others make
them officials appointed to superintend the gymnasia.</p>

<p>The gumnasiarchia is certainly reckoned among leitourgiai
as a general rule. A speaker in Lusias,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_487" id="fnanchor_487"></a><a href="#footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></span>
giving a list of these
duties which he had performed, says: “I supplied a chorus of
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
men at the Thargelia, a chorus of war-dancers at the Panathenaia,
a cyclic chorus at the little Panathenaia, I was Gumnasiarchos
for the Prometheia and was victorious, then choregos with a
chorus of boys, then with beardless war-dancers at the little
Panathenaia.” In Andokides<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_488" id="fnanchor_488"></a><a href="#footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></span>
a gumnasiarchos at the
Hephaisteia is mentioned. The author of the treatise on the
Athenian constitution says:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_489" id="fnanchor_489"></a><a href="#footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></span>
 “In the case of the choregiai,
gumnasiarchiai, and trierarchiai, the Athenians realise that the
rich fill the offices and the populace serve under them and get
the benefit. So the populace claims to be paid for singing and
running and dancing and sailing in the ships.” Now “singing
and dancing” belong to the choregiai, and “sailing in the
ships” to the trierarchiai. So “running” is left for the
gumnasiarchiai. The main feature of the yearly festivals of
Hephaistos and Prometheus, which the two earlier passages
gave as the scene of the duties of the gumnasiarchos, was a
torch-race. It may thus be inferred that the duty of the
gumnasiarchos was to collect, and train, a team of his own
tribe for the torch-race at these festivals.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_490" id="fnanchor_490"></a><a href="#footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></span>
In connection
with this duty, they could prosecute members of their team,
or any one who interfered with them, for impiety before the
Archon Basileus,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_491" id="fnanchor_491"></a><a href="#footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></span>
since the race was a religious function.
They were thus in the sacrosanct position which Demosthenes
as choregos claims for himself in his speech against Meidias.</p>

<p>So far the gumnasiarchos is an ordinary performer of a
leitourgia, and his duties are confined to providing a tribal
team for the torch-races at the Prometheia and Hephaisteia.
His team, usually at any rate, consisted of epheboi, as we learn
from an inscription describing the victory of Eutuchides with
his epheboi.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_492" id="fnanchor_492"></a><a href="#footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>There is also the law quoted as Solon’s in Aischines’
speech against Timarchos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_493" id="fnanchor_493"></a><a href="#footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></span>
 “The gumnasiarch<em>ai</em> (note that
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
it is a different word) “are not to allow any one over age to
keep company with the boys at the festival of Hermes in any
way whatsoever: if he does not keep all such persons out of
the gymnasia, the gumnasiarch<em>es</em> shall be liable to the law that
prescribes penalties for those who corrupt free boys.” But the
orator himself only mentions paidotribai, and special enactments
dealing with the Hermaia; there is no mention of a
gumnasiarches. The law itself is an addition made in a later
period when there was a special officer to control the gymnasia.
But there is no evidence for such an official in the days of the
independence of Hellas.</p>

<p>One interesting passage remains. “I was gumnasiarchos
in my deme,” or country district, says a speaker in Isaios.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_494" id="fnanchor_494"></a><a href="#footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></span>
There must therefore have been local torch-races, for which
rich men were called upon to pay and train teams, just as there
were certainly local theatrical performances. The passage
opens up a prospect of vigorous athletic life throughout the
country districts and villages of Attica.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">SECONDARY EDUCATION: <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> THE SOPHISTS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">At</span> fourteen or soon after, it was usual for the ordinary
course of letters and lyre-playing to terminate: the
gymnastic lessons might be carried on till old age
interrupted them. During the first three-quarters of the
fifth century, the lad, on leaving school, was left to live
more or less as he pleased, if he was rich enough not to
have to work for his living: the sons of poorer citizens
at this age, if not before, settled down to learn a trade
or engaged in merchandise. Rich boys, no doubt, spent
most of their time in athletic pursuits; riding and
chariot-driving were favourite amusements. But with
the Periclean age arose a violent desire for a further
course of intellectual study, and a system of secondary
education arose, to occupy the four years which
elapsed between the time when the lad finished his
primary education and the time when the State
summoned him to undergo his two years of military
training.</p>

<p>Many of the primary schools of the better sort
started courses of study for lads, providing, no doubt,
separate class-rooms, or else the younger boys attended
at different hours from those at which the elder pupils
assembled. Probably some such provision had been
made much earlier for those who wished to obtain a
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
more advanced knowledge of literature and music
than was offered by the primary schools. But in the
time of Sokrates many masters seemed to have held
classes for lads as well as for boys. On entering the
schools of Dionusios,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_495" id="fnanchor_495"></a><a href="#footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></span>
the master of letters, Sokrates
finds a class of lads assembled here.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_496" id="fnanchor_496"></a><a href="#footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></span>
They all belong
to noble families: the poor were no doubt unable to
afford education of this sort. Two of the lads were
busy discussing a point of astronomy, and were quoting
the authority of Oinopides<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_497" id="fnanchor_497"></a><a href="#footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></span>
and Anaxagoras, for
Sokrates catches these two names as he enters the
room. They were drawing circles on the ground and
imitating the inclination of some orbit or other with
their hands. This scene shows a much more advanced
sort of study than was usual at the primary school of
letters. The Sophists seem to have often lectured in
class-rooms.</p>

<p>More often secondary education was imparted, not
in the regular schools by regular, established masters,
but by the wandering savants, who taught every conceivable
subject, and were all grouped together under
the general name of Sophists.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_498" id="fnanchor_498"></a><a href="#footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></span>
From this category the
mathematicians and astronomers, who in all respects
occupied the same position, are often excluded. This
is due to the authority of Plato, who, while detesting
the other subjects taught as secondary education, had a
great affection for mathematics and astronomy, the
only subjects which he prescribes for lads in the
<cite>Republic</cite> and <cite>Laws</cite>. But Aristophanes, taking a
more logical position, includes geometry and astronomy
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
among the subjects taught by the burlesque Sophists
of the <cite>Clouds</cite>. In point of fact, secondary education
included any subject that the lad or his parents
desired; and the wandering professors who imparted
it, and even established teachers like Isokrates, who
kept permanent secondary schools at Athens, were all
alike, in the popular view, Sophists.</p>

<p>But the more important subjects do naturally fall
into two great groups, Mathematics and Rhetoric.
Mathematics, as may be seen from the <cite>Republic</cite>,
meant, as a part of secondary education, the Science of
Numbers, Geometry, and Astronomy, with a certain
amount of the theory of Music, which, owing partly to
Pythagorean traditions, was classed with mathematics.
We have already seen a class learning Astronomy.
Plato, in the <cite>Theaitetos</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_499" id="fnanchor_499"></a><a href="#footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></span>
supplies a sketch of a lesson
in more advanced arithmetic, which, by Hellenic custom,
was usually expressed in geometrical terms in order to
obtain the assistance of a diagram. The lad Theaitetos
says to Sokrates that Theodorus of Kurene, the great
contemporary mathematician, had been teaching him.
“He was giving us a lesson in Roots, with diagrams,
showing us that the root of 3 and the root of 5 did not
admit of linear measurement by the foot (that is, were
not rational). He took each root separately up to 17.
There, as it happened, he stopped. So the other pupil
and I determined, since the roots were apparently
infinite in number, to try to find a single name which
would embrace all these roots.</p>

<p>“We divided all number into two parts. The number
which has a square root we likened to the geometrical
square, and called ‘square and equilateral’ (<span class="decoration">e.g.</span> 4, 9,
16). The intermediate numbers, such as 3 and 5 and
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
the rest which have no square root, but are made up
of unequal factors, we likened to the rectangle with
unequal sides, and called rectangular numbers.” And
so on. As the pupils apply the same principle to
cubes and cube roots, Theodorus must have initiated
them into the mysteries of solid geometry also.</p>

<p>Here we find a professor lecturing to a select class,
in this case of only two lads, and his pupils, as in the
class-room of Dionusios, discussing and elaborating
among themselves afterwards the subject-matter of the
lecture. Theodoros is mentioned as teaching Geometry,
Astronomy, and the theory of Music, as well as the
Science of Numbers. Geometry by this time included
a good number of the easier propositions which were
afterwards incorporated in the works of Euclid; the
school of Pythagoras, and, later, that of Plato, did
much to develop it. The problem of squaring the
circle was already occupying attention.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_500" id="fnanchor_500"></a><a href="#footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></span>
Compasses
and the rule were the ordinary geometrical implements:
diagrams were drawn on the ground, on dust or sand.
In Arithmetic surds<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_501" id="fnanchor_501"></a><a href="#footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></span>
were a popular subject: but
arithmetical problems, being usually expressed in terms
of geometry plane or solid, become as a rule a part of
the latter science.</p>

<p>To Plato these mathematical studies are alone suitable
for secondary education: the philosopher Teles,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_502" id="fnanchor_502"></a><a href="#footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></span>
carrying on the same tradition, makes arithmetic and
geometry the special plagues of the lad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_503" id="fnanchor_503"></a><a href="#footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></span>
But then the
philosophers despised Rhetoric.</p>

<p>Rhetoric, from the time of Gorgias onwards,
formed a very large part of secondary education
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
Isokrates was its greatest professor. He provided in
his school a course of three or four years for lads, to
occupy their time till they were epheboi. But the
methods, the aims, and the personality of this interesting
professor will be discussed later.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Besides mathematics and rhetoric, there were literary
studies. The <cite>Axiochos</cite> gives <ins title="kritikoi">κριτικοί</ins> among the
teachers of a lad. These are the lecturers on literary
subjects, who concerned themselves with interpretations,
often far-fetched, of the poets; a summary of the
literary discussion in the <cite>Protagoras</cite> may give some
idea of such a lesson.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Protagoras.</span> I consider that it is a most important
part of a man’s education to be skilled in poetry;
to understand, that is, what is rightly said, and what is
not, by the poets. Simonides says to Skopas, son of
Kreon the Thessalian, ‘To become indeed a good man is
hard, a man foursquare, wrought without blame in hands
and feet and mind.’ You know the poem? Do you
know then that farther on in the same poem he says,
‘But the saying of Pittakos, wise though he was, seems
to me not said aright: he said, “’Tis hard to be
noble.”’ Don’t you see that the poet has contradicted
himself?”</p>

<p>Sokrates replies by distinguishing “being” from
“becoming,” and suggests that <ins title="chalepos">χαλεπός</ins> (hard) may
mean not “difficult” but “bad.” He then gives a
lecture in his turn. He picks out a <ins title="men">μέν</ins> in the first line
and puts it into a most unwarrantable position in his
translation, and makes “indeed” go with “hard.” To
become good is difficult but possible, to be and remain
good quite impossible. Hence Simonides goes on to
say that he is quite satisfied with those who do no
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
positive harm. Sokrates also notes a philological point,
that <ins title="epainêmi">ἐπαίνημι</ins> in the poem is a Lesbian Aeolic form,
justified because the poem is addressed to a citizen of
Mitulene. It may be remarked that Hippias also
possessed a lecture on the subject. A lecture on
Homer by a Sophist is mentioned by Isokrates: such
lectures were frequently given by the rhapsodes.</p>

<p>Grammar was also taught, and the right use of
words. Less usual subjects were geography,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_504" id="fnanchor_504"></a><a href="#footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></span>
art, and
metre. Logic was in its infancy, but the growing lad
could practise himself in argument by listening to the
disputes of the dialecticians. Current conversation was
full of ethical and political discussions: in the fourth
century there were the philosophical schools of Plato
and, later, of Aristotle, and the lectures of Antisthenes
the cynic in Kunosarges; and Isokrates taught political
science. Lads seem to have been expected to learn
something, at any rate, of the laws of their country: no
doubt they were taken up to the Akropolis to read
Solon’s code: occasionally they may have been present
as spectators in the law-courts, in order that they might
gain an idea of legal procedure. Those who intended
to become speech-writers for the courts would doubtless
learn more: they would also attend some well-known
writer like Lusias or Isaios, and learn the art of forensic
rhetoric.</p>

<p>It must be clearly understood that the whole of this
secondary education was purely voluntary. The parent
need not send his lad to hear any teaching of the sort:
the poorer classes certainly would not. The richer
parents could choose what subjects they or their sons
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
preferred: rhetoric or literature, geography or mathematics&mdash;it
was all one to the State. Teachers came and
went: few stayed in Athens long. Their pupils had
either to follow them abroad, as Isokrates went to
Gorgias in Thessaly, or wait for their next visit. It
was only the schools of Isokrates, of the great philosophers,
and of a few speech-writers like Lusias and Isaios,
that had any permanence in Athens. Isokrates himself
had taught in Chios for a time: Plato was more
than once in Sicily, and his school had to do without
him in his absence. There is a peculiar fluidity about
secondary education in Hellas: the teachers are always
on the move. Endowed buildings for them there were
none: they taught in their own houses and gardens, or
in those of rich hosts, or in school-rooms borrowed for
the occasion, or in public resorts like the gymnasia, or
even in the streets. Consistent or continuous instruction
was the exception: the Sophists proper gave it only to
a few. The average lad at this time naturally acquired
a wide and superficial knowledge of a great number of
subjects, just the amount of knowledge which is such a
dangerous thing. The lads became Jacks-of-all-trades:
Plato, struck with the educational error of wide superficiality,
wrote the <cite>Republic</cite> as a counterblast, preaching
“One man, one trade.” This protest is largely
directed against the specious superficiality of the Sophists’
teaching.</p>

<p>Consequently, secondary education fell into two
halves, the fluid teaching of the wandering Sophists and
the continuous teaching of the more stationary schools
of Plato and Isokrates. It will be convenient to accept
this division, and take the fluid half first. In subjects,
the two must overlap one another: the Sophists taught
logic as much as Plato, rhetoric as much as Isokrates,
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
and universal information of very much the same range
as Aristotle. But the method was different, just because
as a rule the Sophist was here to-day and gone to-morrow,
while the stationary teachers taught the same
pupils for several years together and could study their
particular idiosyncrasies, and the value of education
depends very largely on the teacher’s understanding
of, and sympathy with, the individual boys whom he
teaches.</p>

<p>It is of interest to trace the development of the term
Sophia and of the Sophists who professed it.</p>

<p>The earliest thoughts of the Hellenic peoples were
enshrined in hexameter verse. Homer and Hesiod
represent the science and philosophy, as well as the
religion, of their age. The poetical tradition survived
in philosophy as late as Parmenides and Empedokles:
the last trace of it may perhaps be found in the myths
of Plato. The religious and ritual thinkers and the
composers of oracles also employed verse. Consequently
“wisdom,” in the earliest Hellenic literature, is mainly
associated with poetry and music, and the words <ins title="sophoi">σοφοί</ins>
and <ins title="sophistai">σοφισταί</ins> are applied indiscriminately to poets.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_505" id="fnanchor_505"></a><a href="#footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></span>
This sense of <ins title="sophistês">σοφιστής</ins> survived in later times, and
Protagoras could call Homer, Hesiod, Mousaios,
Orpheus, and Simonides all alike by this title. Orpheus
is so styled in the <cite>Rhesos</cite>. Phrunichos called
Lampros the musician a “hyper-sophist,” and Athenaeus
declares that Sophist was a general title for all
students of music.</p>

<p>A second use of the word “wise man” had also
existed from the earliest times, by which it had been
applied to those who were skilful in some particular
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
craft, such as carpentering,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_506" id="fnanchor_506"></a><a href="#footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></span>
medicine,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_507" id="fnanchor_507"></a><a href="#footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></span>
or chariot-driving.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_508" id="fnanchor_508"></a><a href="#footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The “Seven Sages” also received the name of
Sophist,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_509" id="fnanchor_509"></a><a href="#footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></span>
and in their age the cognate words <ins title="sophos">σοφός</ins> and
<ins title="sophia">σοφία</ins> became connected with practical and political
wisdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_510" id="fnanchor_510"></a><a href="#footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Then the rise of education in Hellas, in which these
old poets and thinkers were largely employed, and the
analogy of the other educational titles with similar
endings, <ins title="grammatistês">γραμματιστής</ins> and <ins title="kitharistês">κιθαριστής</ins>, gave the word
<ins title="sophistês">σοφιστής</ins> an association with the teaching profession.
Scientific knowledge was beginning to accumulate.
Sufficient history was known to serve as a foundation
for political theory and precept. Rhetoric was becoming
an essential preliminary to political life, since, with
the rise of democracy, persuasion became the dominating
influence in law-courts and assemblies. The desire
for knowledge was never so keen as during the latter
half of the fifth century in Hellas. With the demand
came the men. All over the Hellenic world arose
professional teachers, who carried the knowledge, which
they had learnt from one another or discovered for
themselves, from city to city. Everywhere their
lectures attracted large and enthusiastic <a name="crowds" id="crowds"></a>crowds.
Among the subjects which they studied and taught
may be mentioned mathematics (including arithmetic,
geometry, and astronomy), grammar, etymology,
geography, natural history, the laws of metre and
rhythm, history (under which head fell also mythology
and genealogies), politics, ethics, the criticism of
religion, mnemonics, logic, tactics and strategy, music,
drawing and painting, scientific athletics, and, above all,
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
rhetoric. To such a heterogeneous collection what
name could be given but “wisdom,” <ins title="sophia">σοφία</ins>? The
name Sophist was applied indiscriminately to all these
secondary teachers.</p>

<p>There are several interesting accounts of these
Sophists in extant literature, but the writers are always
prejudiced opponents.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Clouds</cite> of Aristophanes, the Sophists and their
pupils are represented as living in an underground
Thinking-Shop. They are pale and squalid, engaged
in all sorts of researches. Natural history is represented
by the important question, “How many times the
length of its own foot does a flea jump?” a problem
which is solved by actual experiment. Later in the
play they inquire why the sea does not overflow, since
the rivers are always running into it. Scientific instead
of mythological explanations of thunder and lightning
are given. There is religious criticism too, such
as Xenophanes had uttered long before: “If Zeus
imprisoned his own father, why has he not been
punished?” There is astronomy, “the paths and orbit
of the sun,” and a hanging basket is introduced as an
observatory. Geometry and compasses are mentioned.
The visitor is shown a map of the world, containing
Euboia, Lakedaimon, and Attica on a large enough
scale, it would seem, to mark the deme Kikunna;
perhaps, as Strepsiades expects to find dikastai on it at
Athens, it had pictures of elephants and monsters in unknown
districts. The students are interested in metres
and rhythms. The poet laughs at grammar, forming
“cockess” as the logical feminine of cock, and making
the chief Sophist object to feminine nouns with
masculine terminations. It is suggested that the pupils
at the Thinking-Shop are dirty, half-starved vegetarians,
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
too economical to go to the hair-cutter or the baths,
abstaining from wine and the gymnasia. But the main
point attacked by Aristophanes is the teaching of
Argument. The whole object of learning under the
Sophists is, according to him, to be able to cajole the
dikastai and so win impunity to cheat, and to have an
argument to justify anything. The successful scholars
beat their fathers and mothers, giving logical reasons
for their behaviour; they refuse to go to school, and
are too clever to believe or accept anything. But their
intellectual exhilaration is spasmodic; they have been
taught, if they reach a difficult problem, to jump on to
something else.</p>

<p>A vivid sketch of Sophist-life is given in Plato’s
<cite>Protagoras</cite>. Young Hippokrates, on returning to
Athens in the evening after pursuing a runaway slave
to the frontier, hears that Protagoras the great Sophist
has arrived in the city. Only the lateness of the hour
deters him from rushing off to find Sokrates, who will
give him an introduction to the teacher. Next morning
he comes round to Sokrates’ house long before it is
light, bangs and shouts at the door in his excitement,
and announces that he is ready to spend all the money
which he and all his friends possess, in fees.</p>

<p>They go off to the house of Kallias, where
Protagoras and other Sophists are staying. The porter
is so worn out by the number of visitors that he is
distinctly rude. They find Protagoras walking up and
down in the cloisters of the house, with three or four
listeners on either side, one of whom is learning to be a
Sophist himself. Behind follows a crowd, mostly composed
of the foreigners whom he draws from city to
city, like Orpheus, with his magic voice. Another
Sophist, Hippias, is sitting on a sort of throne in the
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
opposite part of the cloisters; around him on benches
are a number of inquirers, who were asking him
questions about natural science and astronomy. A
third Sophist, Prodikos, is in a side-building, still in
bed, covered up in blankets.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_511" id="fnanchor_511"></a><a href="#footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></span>
His audience sat on
neighbouring beds. The whole assemblage finally
collect couches and benches together in a great circle to
hear a discussion between Sokrates and Protagoras.
Kallias, the host on this occasion, often entertained
Sophists: at another time he had Gorgias and Polos
in the house. His cloisters must have provided a
favourite lecture-room. The Sophists also haunted
the gymnasia. The discussion in the <cite>Euthudemos</cite>
takes place in the undressing-room of the Lukeion:
the two Sophists have been walking in the cloister.
Hippias on one occasion lectures in a school-room, on
another in a public place at Olympia.</p>

<p>Protagoras was the first of these teachers to take
pay. His system was very fair. On the close of their
course of instruction his pupils, if they chose, paid the
fee for which he asked; otherwise, they went into a
temple, and, after taking an oath, paid as much as they
said his instruction was worth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_512" id="fnanchor_512"></a><a href="#footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></span>
Hippias made about
£600 in a very short time in Sicily, receiving some £80
from the tiny town of Inukos, although Protagoras
was also lecturing in the island at the time. Prodikos
charged £2 for a particular lecture on correct speech,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_513" id="fnanchor_513"></a><a href="#footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></span>
but there was also a less complete form of it which cost
only 10d.; he seems to have been noted for the gradations
in his charges, for there were also lectures at 5d.,
1s. 8d., and 3s. 4d.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_514" id="fnanchor_514"></a><a href="#footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></span>
The sum which Euenos of Paros
asked for teaching the whole duties of a man and a
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
citizen was £20.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_515" id="fnanchor_515"></a><a href="#footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></span>
Probably, however, the charges of
these Sophists, and the money which they made, were
much exaggerated by their contemporaries. Isokrates,
the pupil of Gorgias, gives a much lower estimate.
“None of the so-called Sophists,” he says, “will be
found to have collected much money. On the contrary,
some passed their lives in poverty and the rest in quite
ordinary circumstances. The richest Sophist within
my memory was Gorgias. He spent most of his time
in Thessaly, the most prosperous part of Hellas. He
lived to a great age and followed his profession for a
great many years. He did not take upon himself any
public burdens by settling in any one city. He did not
marry or have children to bring up. Yet with all these
opportunities of growing wealthy, he only left about
£800 at his death.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_516" id="fnanchor_516"></a><a href="#footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></span>
It must be remembered that the
Sophists received money only from those who definitely
enrolled themselves as pupils or came to a few advertised
lectures. Hippias lectured at Sparta frequently, and
never received a penny. Any one might go and ask a
Sophist a question, and would almost always receive a
voluminous answer. The eloquence and practical
skill of these men were also always at the disposal of
their own city. Like the greater Renaissance scholars,
Hippias, Gorgias, and Prodikos were much occupied
in going on embassies. For the larger part of their
life-work they received no payment whatever; what
they actually received was possibly less than what their
philosophic opponents obtained in donations from
friendly tyrants.</p>

<p>At any rate, their fees were not heavy enough to
damp the ardour of their pupils. Young men left
their relations and friends to follow Sophists from
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
city to city. These enthusiastic disciples were almost
ready to carry their teachers about on their shoulders,
so great was their affection for them. Why this
enthusiasm? Partly because the Sophists were men
of great personal charm. Partly because in that age
the thirst for knowledge was unbounded. Partly
from a desire to learn the way of virtue, which the
Sophists claimed to teach. But the most potent reason
was ambition. The young wished to shine in conversation,
the great occupation of the age, and to be able to
discuss every conceivable topic with intelligence. But
education was also the road to political success. The
Sophists taught systematic rhetoric, and logic of a sort.
They also supplied the subject-matter for orations, in
their practical handling of political science, of history,
of ethical commonplaces; for a public oration was
expected to be a storehouse of erudition. Rhetoric
was needful not only for power, but also for security;
for in the courts it had more influence than mere
argument and facts.</p>

<p>About the individual Sophists little is known. They
appear for us only in the pages of those who traduced
them. Plato is mainly occupied with various conclusions
which he draws from their philosophic theories,
which were not a part of their teaching. <cite>Protagoras</cite>, the
eldest of them, a most dignified personage, set himself
to train good citizens: he claimed that he enabled his
pupils to manage their households and govern their
states. He imparted to them all the worldly wisdom
which he had gained by long years of personal experience.
He made a special study of political science, no
doubt for this purpose, and left a treatise upon the
subject, which was sufficiently excellent for a certain
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
Aristoxenos to be able to say that Plato had plagiarised
most of the <cite>Republic</cite> from it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_517" id="fnanchor_517"></a><a href="#footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></span>
Being businesslike, he
favoured clearness of thought, and studied grammar: he
was the first to separate nouns into the three genders.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_518" id="fnanchor_518"></a><a href="#footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Prodikos</cite> belonged to the same practical school. He
began by teaching his pupils the right use of words.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_519" id="fnanchor_519"></a><a href="#footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></span>
Thus he told Sokrates not to use <ins title="deinos">δεινός</ins> when he meant
“clever”; for its proper meaning was “terrible,”
applicable to war, disease, or the like.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_520" id="fnanchor_520"></a><a href="#footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></span>
There is an
amusing skit on his pet subject in Plato.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_521" id="fnanchor_521"></a><a href="#footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></span>
“The audience
in a philosophical debate should give an impartial
but not an equal attention to both speakers; for it is
not the same thing. For it is right to give an impartial
hearing, but you ought to incline, not equally towards
both, but rather towards the wiser speaker. I also ask
you to agree, and to discuss, not to dispute. For
friends discuss with friends for friendship’s sake, but
enemies dispute. In this way our meeting will be best
conducted. For you, the speakers, would thus win
from the audience most repute, not praise (for repute
is without deception in the minds of the hearers, but
praise is an outward expression of what is often not
felt); and we, the audience, would thus receive most
happiness, not pleasure; for happiness is produced by
the mental reception of knowledge and wisdom, pleasure
by eating or by some other pleasant physical state.”
It was easy to laugh, but, as Plato himself shows, these
distinctions of meaning were extremely useful in meeting
logical quibbles, and were much needed in contemporary
logic. Besides this, Prodikos was a moral
teacher, and composed the famous <cite>Choice of Herakles</cite>,
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
in which he inculcated the duty of hard work as opposed
to a life of laziness and pleasure. He was an invalid,
but worked on in spite of ill-health; the result was,
perhaps, a certain amount of pessimism.</p>

<p><span class="person">Hippias</span> was a marvellously all-round genius. He
once came to the Olympian festival with everything
that he wore or carried made by himself, ring, oil bottle,
shoes, clothes, a wonderful Persian girdle; he also
brought epic poems, tragedies, dithyrambs, and all sorts
of prose-works.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_522" id="fnanchor_522"></a><a href="#footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></span>
He knew astronomy, geometry,
arithmetic, grammar. At Sparta he taught history and
archæology. He had a wonderful system of mnemonics,
by which, if he once heard a string of fifty names, he
could remember them all.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_523" id="fnanchor_523"></a><a href="#footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></span>
He lectured on Homer
and other poets. He also composed a moral discourse,
which won great applause at Sparta, where quibbles or
bad morality would have been sternly repressed; it
was afterwards delivered in an Athenian school-room.
Hippias was always ready to answer any question which
was put to him, and was rarely at a loss.</p>

<p>A less prominent Sophist was <span class="person">Antiphon</span>, who must
be carefully distinguished from his namesake the Attic
orator. He published works on physics, on concord
(<ins title="homonoia">ὁμόνοια</ins>), and on political science. The fragments are
interesting, and show some popular handling of ethical
teaching. The following extracts<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_524" id="fnanchor_524"></a><a href="#footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></span>
will give some idea
of the <span class="lock">man:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“First among things human I reckon education.
For if you begin anything whatever in the right way,
the end will probably be right also. The nature of the
harvest depends upon the seed you sow. If you plant
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
good education in a young body, it bears leaves and
fruit the whole life long, and no rain or drought can
destroy it.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Life is like a day’s sentry-duty, and the length of
life is comparable to a single day. While our day
lasts, we look up to the sunlight, then we pass on our
duty to our successors.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A miser stored up money in a hiding-place, and
did not lend or use it. Then it was stolen. A man to
whom he had refused to lend it told him to put a stone
in the hiding-place instead, and imagine that it was
money; it would be just as useful.”</p>

<p>Among the Sophists were some apparently who were
merely jesters, and used their brains solely in arousing
laughter. It may well be doubted whether the account
which Plato gives of <span class="person">Euthudemos</span> and <span class="person">Dionusodoros</span> is
true to life; but they probably represent a type. As
teachers, no sane man could take them seriously. They
had been gladiators, and had taught forensic rhetoric;
afterwards they discovered a genius for quibbles. They
were ready to make out any statement to be true or
false. The respondent may only answer “Yes” or
“No,” and no previous statement could be quoted
against them, since they did not claim to teach anything
consistent. A sample<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_525" id="fnanchor_525"></a><a href="#footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></span>
of their arguments will make
their methods clearer. “<span class="decoration">A.</span> Your father is a dog. <span class="decoration">B.</span>
So is yours. <span class="decoration">A.</span> If you answer my questions, you will
admit it. Have you a dog? <span class="decoration">B.</span> Yes, a very bad one.
<span class="decoration">A.</span> Has it puppies? <span class="decoration">B.</span> Mongrels like itself. <span class="decoration">A.</span>
Then the dog is a father? <span class="decoration">B.</span> Yes. <span class="decoration">A.</span> Isn’t the dog
yours? <span class="decoration">B.</span> Certainly. <span class="decoration">A.</span> Then being yours and a
father, it is your father, and you are the brother of
puppies.” Absurd as it is, such discussions are a good
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
means of teaching logic, since they make the search for
rules intellectually compulsory.</p>

<p>No doubt there were black sheep among the lesser
Sophists, to whom Plato’s bitter definitions in the
<cite>Sophist</cite> were quite applicable, who were “hunters
after young men of wealth and position, with sham
education as their bait, and a fee for their object, making
money by a scientific use of quibbles in private conversation,
while quite aware that what they were teaching
was wrong.” But they do not appear in extant literature,
which has only recorded a very few, and those the
very pick, of the hundreds of Sophists that there must
have been in the Socratic age.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_526" id="fnanchor_526"></a><a href="#footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>The Sophists who have been mentioned so far have
been but little concerned with Rhetoric: they form
rather a school of Logic, opposed to the rhetorical school
of <span class="person">Gorgias</span> and his followers.</p>

<p>Of the rise of Rhetoric in Hellas I need say little:
the whole subject has been admirably treated elsewhere.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_527" id="fnanchor_527"></a><a href="#footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></span>
For educational purposes, Hellenic rhetoric started with
several fatal drawbacks and some counterbalancing
advantages. The southern nature of the Hellenes preferred
sensuous charm of sound to logical accuracy of
fact; their rhetoric, arising as it did out of poetry, and
modelling itself upon its literary parent, pandered only
too readily to their taste. With truth it had no more
to do than Homer had; its object was to please the ear
by curious rhythms, balanced clauses, parisosis, and all
other possible devices. As long as the form was excellent,
no matter how trivial the subject:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_528" id="fnanchor_528"></a><a href="#footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></span>
mice or salt
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
were good enough for a theme. The oration must, of
course, be full of passion, but that could be simulated:
rhetoric had inherited the legacy of acting from its
parent, Lyric Poetry. So rhetoric became simply a
question of style, not of argument; and since arguments
were not required, the strength or weakness of a
case did not matter: rhetoric could make any cause
attractive to a sensuous Hellenic ear by its tricks of
style, and thus make “the weaker cause the stronger.”
The method by which its professors taught their pupils
brought out this attitude clearly. They were accustomed
to take an imaginary case, and then to teach their pupils
how to write a speech on either side of it: the extant
“Tetralogies” of Antiphon are examples of the
method, which was excellent educationally; for it is
good to see the arguments on both sides of a case. It
was the carelessness about fact and indifference to truth,
and the element of acting, that were so dangerous to
the pupils. These elements certainly wrecked the justice
of the Athenian courts; their effect on Hellenic character
was probably equally unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Rhetoric also inherited the “gnome” or commonplace,
a general statement about ethics or politics or
what not, which could be developed into a sententious
little essay. Budding orators learned to compose a
little store of these and keep them ready for use, to
be inserted in a speech whenever an opportunity
occurred. For writing these essays, a certain amount
of independent thought about politics and ethics was
necessary; and both the thought and the essay-writing
were no doubt good for the lads.</p>

<p>The flowery and poetic style, which was the main
characteristic of early Hellenic rhetoric, was the creation
of Gorgias. A fragment of a funeral oration, in which
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
no doubt he put forth all his powers, may be given as a
sample of the sort of thing which his pupils learned to
<span class="lock">write:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“As witness to their deeds these dead set up trophies
over the foe, offerings to Zeus, offered by themselves.
They were not unskilled in natural Ares nor lawful
loves nor armèd strife nor beauty-loving Peace; revering
the Gods by Justice, honouring their parents by
Service, just to their countrymen by Equality, faithful
to their friends by Loyalty. Therefore, when they died,
love for them died not with them, but deathless in
bodies no longer bodies it lives when they live no
longer.” In the <cite>Encomium on Helen</cite> we have “fright
exceeding fearful, and pity exceeding tearful, and yearning
exceeding painful,” and “productive of pleasure,
destructive of pain.” In the <cite>Palamedes</cite> Gorgias even
uses puns.</p>

<p>His poetical compounds and those of his pupil
<span class="person">Alkidamas</span> were famous. In short, at this time there
was no boundary whatever between poetry and prose:
prose, if anything, was the more poetical of the two.</p>

<p>This strange hothouse Euphuistic style of Gorgias
took Hellas by storm, and his influence was enormous:
it even half-mastered the austere mind of Thucydides.
As reformed by the greater critical faculties of his pupil
Isokrates, it became the parent of Ciceronian Latin and
so of the prose literature of centuries.</p>

<p>The other rhetorical Sophists of the time are less
interesting. <span class="person">Likumnios</span> and <span class="person">Polos</span>, teacher and pupil,
seem to have devoted themselves to questions of
rhythm: they employed quaint conceits and affectations,
like Gorgias. <span class="person">Theodoros</span> and <span class="person">Euenos</span> divided and subdivided
the parts of an oration into “confirmation” and
“additional confirmation,” and “by-blames” and “by-panegyrics”:
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
in which work Polos joined them.
<span class="person">Thrasumachos</span> of Chalcedon, who seems to have been a
bigger man altogether, began to attack the psychological
side of rhetoric by studying the questions of pathos and
indignation; these studies he embodied in pamphlets,
and no doubt his results were imparted to his pupils.</p>

<p>One of the beauties of old Hellenic education had
been that it did not make the rich a class apart from
the poor by giving a widely different form of culture.
The rise of the Sophists changed all this: their fees
excluded the poor. The odium of resultant class-separation
fell upon the teachers. Their pupils, rich,
aristocratic, and cultured, inclined towards oligarchy.
Hellenic sentiment held the teacher responsible for the
whole career of his pupils. So for this reason again the
democracies regarded the Sophists with suspicion, as
the trainers of oligarchs and tyrants. It was chiefly
because he had been the teacher of Kritias and Alkibiades
that Sokrates was put to death by the restored democracy.
The persuasive powers which the rhetoricians
gave to their pupils might be, and often were, misused;
the pupils might mislead the Ekklesia into
bad policy or the law-courts into injustice by their
eloquence. However much the Sophists might protest
that they taught only rhetoric, not ethics, they were
held responsible for the dishonesty as well as for the
eloquence of such pupils. Besides, rhetoric gave the
rich man, who alone could buy it, a most undemocratic
influence in the State. The odium against the Sophists
was increased by their religious and political views.
They were free thinkers in all things. Protagoras was
a frank agnostic; Gorgias believed that nothing whatever
existed. Their political theories were equally
revolutionary, full of the idea of Social Contracts and
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
the right of the one strong man. All this was extremely
distasteful to the majority, who were democratic
and orthodox. But it must be remembered that no
such views appeared in lectures: they were confined to
an occasional book or to private conversation. Outwardly
the Sophists were law-abiding and respectable
servants of the constitution, and their lectures were, if
anything, rather commonplace.</p>

<p>Thus the prejudice against them was excited partly
by their freethinking and partly by their fees. The
first of these two reasons applied still more to Sokrates
and the philosophic schools. But Sokrates neither
asked nor received fees: Plato and Aristotle only
accepted presents. Consequently when the philosophic
party tried to dissociate themselves in the popular mind
from the Sophists with whom they were confounded,
they attempted to revive the old Hellenic prejudice
against taking fees for “wisdom,” which had given
trouble to the lyric poets, and to emphasise the money-making
aspects of the Sophists’ profession. This rather
absurd appeal to the gallery has influenced posterity;
but it did not win universal acceptation in Hellas.
Aischines still calls Sokrates a Sophist. Under the
Roman Empire “Sophist” became a title of distinction
applied to artistic stylists and teachers like Libanius.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">SECONDARY EDUCATION: <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> THE PERMANENT SCHOOLS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Athens</span> was the place in which the fluid educational
system of the Sophists would naturally begin to crystallise.
Not only were the Athenians the keenest and most
intellectual of the Hellenes: owing to the vast trade
of their city, merchants, astronomers, inventors, poets,
thinkers of all sorts, poured into it, and men of all trades
and all tongues collected there. Many stayed there for
a few days only, in passing; for Athens was a sort of
Clapham Junction in those days. All these brought a
perpetual supply of new ideas into the city, which the
inhabitants were quick to assimilate.</p>

<p>But, possessing all the advantages of a commercial
centre, Athens was free from the disadvantages. The
clamour and vulgarity of trade were confined to the
Peiraieus: in the gymnasia or the streets or the colonnades
of Athens the philosopher and the thinker could
teach and meditate in peace, in an atmosphere ennobled
by her treasures of architecture and art and sculpture,
which subdued the most blatant visitor, amid the literary
circles which her dramatic contests attracted and encouraged.
Here was an ideal spot for the meeting-place
of the best minds in Hellas and the growth of a
great educational system. The city was an education
in itself. Perikles had called Athens the school of
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
Hellas; the name was now to be justified in its most
literal sense.</p>

<p>Early in the fourth century there arose established
secondary schools in Athens. Plato began to teach
Logic and Philosophy, Isokrates Rhetoric, not for a few
weeks at a time, but permanently: their courses lasted
three or four years. Characteristically, there was no
State organisation or interference; Isokrates taught in
his own house, near the Lukeion, Plato in his garden
near Kolonos and in the Akademeia. Their pupils came
from all parts of the civilised world, staying in Athens
during their course of study. Plato imposed a preliminary
examination in mathematics upon his pupils;
Isokrates only commended a knowledge of such subjects.
The students of these two schools became recognised
features of Athenian life.</p>

<p>Plato led his pupils towards intellectual research and
a life of retirement; the tendency of the school was
markedly aristocratic, and several of the lads became
tyrants in after life. Isokrates inculcated the practical
life: his teaching was meant as a preparation for success
in society and politics. But as his school naturally was
only for the comparatively wealthy and leisured classes,
it also tended to be aristocratic; however, it produced
some of the leading democratic statesmen of the day.</p>

<p>Besides these two great schools others grew up. It
is hard to distinguish exactly between the boys who
went to Isokrates in order to learn political speaking
and those who went to a “logographos” like Lusias
or Demosthenes to learn forensic oratory. The
“logographoi” do not seem to have claimed to impart
culture, but only technical instruction: they are thus
on the boundary line of education. But Demosthenes
went to the “logographos” Isaios to get precisely the
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
instruction which Isokrates had refused him: so it is
hard to make a clear distinction. I shall therefore give
a short sketch of the “logographoi” also.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_529" id="fnanchor_529"></a><a href="#footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></span>
</p>

<p>By the time that these schools began to establish
themselves the Sophists were beginning to die out.
Times were harder in the fourth century, and fewer
people had money to spend on these expensive teachers.
The intellectual movement of the Periclean age had
spent itself, and the desire for universal knowledge was
no longer so keen. Moreover, it is quite probable that
settled schools, like that of Isokrates at Athens, were
forming in many of the great centres: it is known that
Isokrates himself taught for a while in Chios. The
great demerit of the Sophists’ teaching, namely, that it
was too much in a hurry and gave no time for personal
endeavour on the part of the pupil, had been recognised:
and the result was that the Sophists settled down in a
single place and gave continuous courses of instruction.</p>

<p>But a good many Sophists of the old type remained,
to vex Isokrates by their criticisms and rivalries. They
still came to Athens at the great festivals, and gave
hurried lectures.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_530" id="fnanchor_530"></a><a href="#footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></span>
But they had not the originality of
their predecessors, and people preferred to read the
works of Protagoras or Gorgias for themselves to hearing
them repeated as original by a lecturer. Books
were already a serious rival to lecturing, and were a
cause of much searching of heart to Plato: Isokrates,
however, preferred to write himself and so advertise his
school.</p>

<p>Besides the wandering Sophists there were probably
a good many teachers, both of Philosophy and of
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
Rhetoric, established permanently at Athens. Isokrates
mentions casually that all the schools<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_531" id="fnanchor_531"></a><a href="#footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></span>
produce only
two or three first-class speakers. In his educational
prospectus, <cite>Against the Sophists</cite>, he criticises these
rivals freely. “They merely try to attract pupils by
low fees and big promises. The speeches which they
write themselves are worse than the improvisations of
the wholly untrained, yet they promise to make a complete
orator out of any one who comes to them; for
they make no allowance for natural talent or for experience,
but regard eloquence as an exact science, just like
the A B C and equally communicable; whereas it is
really a progressive art, where the same thing must
never be said twice, and its rules must be relative to the
occasion and the circumstances.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_532" id="fnanchor_532"></a><a href="#footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></span>
It is clear that these
rivals committed the serious crime of underselling
Isokrates and also of issuing more attractive prospectuses;
perhaps, too, they are the captious critics to
whom he is always referring.</p>

<p>Isokrates is still more severe on various philosophical
teachers; he cannot mean Plato alone, for he mentions
their fees, and Plato made no charge. There must have
been a large number of philosophical professors, of
whom Plato was only the most brilliant. But in many
points Isokrates no doubt meant his denunciations to
apply to Plato also. The summary of his attack is as
follows:&mdash;“They make impossible offers, promising to
impart to their pupils an exact science of conduct, by
means of which they will always know what to do.
Yet for this science they charge only 3 or 4 <ins title="mnai">μναῖ</ins> (£12
or £16), a ridiculously small sum. They try to attract
pupils by the specious titles of the subjects which they
claim to teach, such as Justice and Prudence. But the
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
Justice and the Prudence which they teach are of a very
peculiar sort, and they give a meaning to the words
quite different from that which ordinary people give;
in fact, they cannot be sure about the meaning themselves,
but can only dispute about it. Although they
profess to teach Justice, they refuse to trust their pupils,
but make them deposit the fees with a third party
before the course begins.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_533" id="fnanchor_533"></a><a href="#footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></span>
Here we have a picture of
a distinct group of ethical teachers all trying to work
at that Socratic paradox that virtue is knowledge, and
imparting their results to pupils for low fees.</p>

<p>All these Professors of Ethics seem to have made
Mathematics and Astronomy a part of their course,
just as Plato did. “To the old Athenian education, of
Letters and Music and Gymnastics, they have added a
more advanced course, consisting of Geometry and
Astronomy and such subjects, together with eristic
dialogues,” that is, Dialectic.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_534" id="fnanchor_534"></a><a href="#footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></span>
This course seems to have
been much criticised as being a mere waste of time, since
it was of no practical use and the knowledge so obtained
was soon forgotten in after life. But Isokrates, although
these subjects played no part in his own school, was
sufficiently good an educationalist to see their merits:
the study of subtle and difficult matters like Astronomy
and Geometry “trains a boy to keep his attention
closely fixed upon the point at issue and not to allow his
mind to wander; so, being practised in this way and
having his wits sharpened, he will be made capable of
learning more important matters with greater ease and
speed.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_535" id="fnanchor_535"></a><a href="#footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></span>
But all these unpractical, if improving,
studies should be abandoned before the nineteenth
year: for they dry up the human nature and make men
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
unbusinesslike. “Some of those who have become so
adept in these subjects that they teach them to others,
show themselves in the practical conduct of life less
wise than their pupils, not to say than their servants.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_536" id="fnanchor_536"></a><a href="#footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></span>
Consequently, those who care to study mathematics and
eristic should confine them to the years between fourteen
and eighteen: and then pass on to learn rhetoric
with Isokrates; the rest can come to his school as lads,
as many did.</p>

<p>But, although he differentiated himself so carefully
from what moderns would call the philosophical schools,
Isokrates styled himself a teacher of philosophy quite as
much as they did. To him, as to the Romans, philosophy
was the art of living a practical life. “That
which is of no immediate use either for speech or for
action does not deserve the name of Philosophy.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_537" id="fnanchor_537"></a><a href="#footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></span>
The
true philosopher is not the dreamer who neglects what
is practical and essential, but the man of the world who
learns and studies subjects which will make him able to
manage his household and govern his state well; for
this is the object of all labour and all philosophy.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></span>
With this practical end in view he ridicules the metaphysical
researches of “the old Sophists, of whom
Demokritos said that the number of realities was infinite,
and Empedokles declared for four, and Ion for not
more than three, and Alkmaion for only two, and
Parmenides and Melissos for one, while Gorgias asserted
that nothing existed at all.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_538" id="fnanchor_538"></a><a href="#footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In the promises which he makes of imparting to his
pupils this practical wisdom which he calls philosophy,
Isokrates is characteristically cautious. An exact
science, which will embrace all possible questions and
circumstances which may arise in domestic and political
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
matters, is an impossibility; men must be content with
a general capacity of forming a right judgment in view
of each particular case when it arises. Consequently he
defines as “wise men,” <ins title="sophoi">σοφοί</ins>, “those whose judgment
usually hits upon the right course of action,” and as
“seekers after wisdom” or philosophers, <ins title="philosophoi">φιλόσοφοι</ins>,
“those who occupy themselves with those studies and
pursuits from which they will most quickly obtain this
practical wisdom,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_539" id="fnanchor_539"></a><a href="#footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></span>
or capacity of forming correct
judgments. But a judgment can only be formed
properly after a proper deliberation: so the work of
Philosophy is to practise her pupils in this deliberation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_540" id="fnanchor_540"></a><a href="#footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></span>
</p>

<p>This practice is, of course, provided in the school
of Isokrates; for his school was, in fact, a debating
or deliberating society, in which the pupils wrote and
recited carefully composed speeches on given themes,
or listened to the harangues of their master. Sometimes
they discussed events of the day and matters of general
interest<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_541" id="fnanchor_541"></a><a href="#footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></span>
at the moment; at another time their topic
was some constitutional or historical question, or the
comparative merits of different nations and governments.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_542" id="fnanchor_542"></a><a href="#footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></span>
At another time, as may be seen from the example of
Isokrates’ own orations, they dealt with those mythical
characters who were historical realities as well as sacred
personages to the average Hellene, Theseus and Helen
and Bousiris: this in their eyes was almost equivalent
to religious instruction and they were virtually writing
theological essays. No doubt also the pupils wrote
and recited those “commonplaces” or short essays on
general topics, composed in a most elaborate style,
which ancient orators kept in stock, ready to be inserted
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
in a speech when a suitable opening presented itself.
Isokrates’ own works are particularly full of these
highly finished little essays:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_543" id="fnanchor_543"></a><a href="#footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></span>
so it is at least extremely
probable that he insisted upon their composition in his
school. Before his pupils, too, Isokrates would recite
those fine sermons of his, like the <cite>Demonikos</cite>; and
effective pieces of moral exhortation they must have
been.</p>

<p>Thus the Isocratean school claimed to be, and was,
a school of morals: it was also a school of good style
and composition. The boys’ essays had to be written
in a particular style, grandiloquent and ornate, to suit
their themes. “For it is absurd to suppose that the
matter and manner of ordinary conversation or of
forensic oratory are suitable to Pan-Hellenic themes;
on the contrary, in this kind of speech the thoughts
must be more original and more lofty, the style more
striking, and the diction more poetical and elaborate.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_544" id="fnanchor_544"></a><a href="#footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></span>
Style, diction, and matter must, in fact, be that which
Isokrates worked out in his own speeches. That style<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_545" id="fnanchor_545"></a><a href="#footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></span>
I do not mean to discuss here. The fact that he wrote
in a study and never spoke in public, has made him
exaggerate the merits of the artistic prose-style of which
he was the first really great exponent; but of its
popularity with an Hellenic audience there can be no
question. The pupils of Isokrates became the most
eminent politicians and the most eminent prose-writers
of the time; his house, as Cicero puts it, was the school
of Hellas and the manufactory of eloquence.</p>

<p>To acquire this kind of oratory, there was need both
of natural ability and of diligent study. Isokrates
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
professes to supply, first an exact science of all the
rhetorical devices and the various forms which speech
can take, and then practice in the right employment
and arrangement of these several parts. To learn the
technique of rhetoric is comparatively easy, if the
aspirant applies to the right man; but the right use of
the technique can never be brought under any set of
rules, or taught by one man to another: it can only be
learnt by experience. The future orator must try the
effect of each arrangement and combination of technique
on the audience, and so draw up his own system.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_546" id="fnanchor_546"></a><a href="#footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></span>
The
requisite audience for these experiments will be provided
by the other pupils of the school, with the master
as chief critic. A good master is essential. By his
personal influence he will be able to communicate those
finer elements of style which cannot be communicated
in formal teaching. If he is worth his salt, all his
pupils will bear the stamp of his own manner, and will
easily be distinguished from every one else by the
similarity of their style to his and to one another’s.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_547" id="fnanchor_547"></a><a href="#footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></span>
Education in rhetoric at Isokrates’ school seems to have
begun with the study of his own works. In the
<cite>Panathenaikos</cite> he describes himself as reading the
speech over with two or three of his regular pupils;
they revise and criticise it as they go along. This
would give Isokrates the opportunity of expounding
his own views of technique, with his own works before
him as illustrations. It may be inferred from the
beginning of the <cite>Bousiris</cite> that the written speeches
of other Sophists were also studied, and their faults, or
aberrations from Isocratean canons, pointed out, in
order that they might be avoided in future. At any
rate, Isokrates complains that other professors of the
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
same sort of Rhetoric at Athens made use of his
writings for teaching their own pupils, though, of
course, according to him, they did so in order to show
the boys what to admire, not what to avoid. When
this technique had been fully mastered Isokrates set his
pupils to write speeches on their own account, choosing
for them some great and improving theme: in these
speeches they had to apply the rules which they had
learnt, and the subtler influences which they had imbibed,
from their teacher. But they had also to think
out the subject-matter, and in this lies much of the
merit of the whole system. For, as Isokrates observes,
the essayist who writes upon such themes will have to
think noble thoughts, and select noble deeds as his
instances and illustrations. This contemplation of what
is noble will be a greater incentive to virtue than any
so-called science of ethics:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_548" id="fnanchor_548"></a><a href="#footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></span>
for there is no science
which can create goodness in wicked natures, but exhortation
and persuasion can work wonders. Moreover,
since the orator’s best argument is, after all, a good
reputation, the young orator will see that his conduct
and character are as excellent as possible.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></span>
And the
practice of weighing just what thoughts and actions are
suitable to the speech involves that faculty of sound
deliberation which is necessary for the formation of
right judgments. In fact, Isocratean “Philosophy”
does more to form character than it does to produce
eloquence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_549" id="fnanchor_549"></a><a href="#footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The pupils practised themselves, as we have seen, by
delivering their harangues before Isokrates and their
fellow-pupils. The school formed a select clique of
trained critics of Rhetoric; the encouragement of
criticism by this means must have been valuable. To
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
this council Isokrates submitted his own orations before
publication; former pupils were also invited to attend
on these occasions. There is an interesting account of
such an assembly at the end of the <cite>Panathenaikos</cite>. “I
was revising the speech as it stands down to this point,”
Isokrates says, “with three or four of the lads who are
accustomed to study with me. On reading it through,
we were satisfied with it and thought it only needed a
peroration. I determined, however, to send for one of
those among my pupils who had been brought up in an
oligarchy and had set themselves to praise Lakedaimon,
so that he might notice any false charge which we had
unwittingly brought against the Spartans.” The pupil
comes, and, while praising the speech enthusiastically,
makes an unguarded criticism of its matter which led
to a long discussion, in the course of which he and
Isokrates deliver lengthy harangues. Finally, the pupil
is crushed. The boys who had been present throughout
the discussion were completely convinced by
Isokrates and applauded him warmly. But the master
himself was not satisfied. So three or four days later
he called together all his old pupils who were in
Athens, and the speech was submitted to their judgment,
and received with enthusiastic applause. The
former critic then delivered a brilliant harangue, trying
to elucidate a hidden meaning in the speech. “The
crowd of pupils, which is usually ready to applaud,
shouted, flocked round him, and congratulated him,
thoroughly agreeing with his eulogy of me,” says
Isokrates. “I praised him too, but did not reveal
whether he had hit off my secret meaning or not.”</p>

<p>The whole tone of the passage suggests that such
an appeal to the pupils for criticism and advice was
common, the only extraordinary feature being the
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
presence of the “old boys.” This view is supported
by other passages. In the <cite>Areiopagitikos</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_550" id="fnanchor_550"></a><a href="#footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></span>
Isokrates
tells his imaginary audience that “Some who heard me
on a former occasion describe this constitution which
Athens once enjoyed, while praising it enthusiastically
and calling our ancestors happy,… told me that I
was not likely to persuade you to adopt it.” On
another occasion his speech made such an impression
upon this preliminary audience that “No one praised
the beauty of the style, as they usually do, but all
admired the truth of the argument.” When he first
told his pupils that he meant to send an advisory
speech to Philip, “they all thought he was mad, and
had the impudence to rebuke him, a thing which they
had never done before.… But when they had heard
the speech, they changed their minds completely and
thought that Philip, Athens, and all Hellas would alike
be grateful to him.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_551" id="fnanchor_551"></a><a href="#footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Isokrates’ great political pamphlets, with their
wonderfully polished style and their striking themes,
naturally served him as an excellent advertisement, as
he naïvely admits in the <cite>Antidosis</cite>. Those who
required further information about his educational
methods and aims would turn to the prospectus
<cite>Against the Sophists</cite>, which he published at the
beginning of his career. Owing to these attractions,
pupils came to him from all parts of the Hellenic
world, from Pontos, Sicily, and Cyprus;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_552" id="fnanchor_552"></a><a href="#footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></span>
he had
“more than all the other teachers of philosophy put
together.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_553" id="fnanchor_553"></a><a href="#footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></span>
They were not merely private citizens,
but statesmen, generals, kings, and tyrants.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_554" id="fnanchor_554"></a><a href="#footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></span>
Probably
the age at which they came varied greatly, but most
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
of his actual pupils would probably be between fifteen
and twenty-one. He often speaks of <ins title="meirakia">μειράκια</ins> as among
them. Moreover, he speaks of parents bringing their
sons to him,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_555" id="fnanchor_555"></a><a href="#footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></span>
which they certainly would not do if the
boys were over eighteen. Public life in the average
Hellenic state began at twenty; so boys would wish
to be ready for it by that age. The course at Isokrates’
school lasted for three or four years.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_556" id="fnanchor_556"></a><a href="#footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></span>
The Athenian
lad was more or less busy with his military duties from
eighteen to twenty, so he would probably take the
course between fourteen and eighteen; natives of other
states would fit it in according to their local customs.
The fee for the whole course was 10 mnai, or £40.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_557" id="fnanchor_557"></a><a href="#footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></span>
The story<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_558" id="fnanchor_558"></a><a href="#footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></span>
goes that Demosthenes, having only £8,
offered to pay that sum for one-fifth of the course.
But Isokrates replied that he could not sell his philosophy
in slices; the customer must take the whole fish
or none at all. Probably, however, the tale is a fiction:
Isokrates himself claims not to have made any money
out of his countrymen, and only to have charged his
foreign pupils.</p>

<p>Since, soon after the opening of his school, he had
a hundred pupils, the accounts of his great wealth,
which he repudiated so indignantly, cannot have been
far wrong, especially as he received 20 talents
(nearly £5000) for his panegyric on Euagoras. His
own comparison of his wealth with that of Gorgias,
who left only £800 at his death, is curious, if the above
statements are true.</p>

<p>But his pupils, drawn from a class that had sufficient
substance to live at leisure,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_559" id="fnanchor_559"></a><a href="#footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></span>
seem to have been well
satisfied with what they got for their money. “At
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
the end of their time, when they were on the point
of sailing home to their friends, they so loved their
life in Athens that they parted from it with tears and
sighs.” Isokrates kept on friendly terms with them
afterwards. Thus he writes to Timotheos, tyrant of
Herakleia and an old pupil, to congratulate him on
his accession and commend to him another old pupil,
Autokrator. Then there is the charming letter in
which he introduces Diodotos, another of his pupils, to
the Macedonian Antipater, at some personal risk, for
there was war between Athens and Macedon at the
time. “I have had many pupils,” the letter runs,
“some of whom have become great orators, some men
of action, some great thinkers, some, with no particular
talents, have at any rate become upright and cultured
gentlemen: Diodotos combines all these qualities.”</p>

<p>The chief boast of the school of Isokrates was
that it produced gentlemen. Isokrates defines education
not as a knowledge of metaphysics and a contemplation
of the Good, nor yet as technical ability
in some particular profession, art, or trade, but as a
sort of culture and polish. “This is my definition of
the educated man,” he says. “First, he is capable of
dealing with the ordinary events of life, by possessing a
happy sense of fitness and a faculty of usually hitting
upon the right course of action.</p>

<p>“Secondly, his behaviour in any society is always
correct and proper. If he is thrown with offensive or
disagreeable company, he can meet it with easy good-temper;
and he treats every one with the utmost
fairness and gentleness.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, he always has the mastery over his
pleasures, and does not give way unduly under misfortune
and pain, but behaves in such cases with
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
manliness and worthily of the nature which has been
given to us.</p>

<p>“Fourthly (the most important point) he is not
spoilt or puffed up nor is his head turned by success,
but he continues throughout to behave like a wise
man, taking less pleasure in the good things which
chance has given him at birth than in the products of
his own talents and intelligence.</p>

<p>“Those whose soul is well tuned to play its part in
all these ways, those I call wise and perfect men, and
declare to possess all the virtues; those I regard as
truly educated.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_560" id="fnanchor_560"></a><a href="#footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Thus the object of Isokrates was rather to impart
culture and polish to his pupils than to teach them
rhetoric; it is in this point that he differs from the
other professors who taught the same sort of rhetoric
as he did at Athens and have now been forgotten, and
from the logographoi, who taught the kind of speaking
which suited the Athenian law-courts, without professing
to supply anything but a technical knowledge of
their particular subject.</p>

<p>In an Athenian trial the prosecutor and defendant
had each to deliver a speech for themselves; afterwards,
regular advocates might address the jury in some cases,
but this was rare. So the duty of an Athenian lawyer
was simply to write speeches for his clients to deliver,
not to speak himself. Thus the metic Lusias, who
had no right to speak in a court himself, was a famous
lawyer, or logographos, speech-writer, as the Hellenes
called him.</p>

<p>Mantitheos, say, finds himself involved in a lawsuit.
He comes to Lusias and explains the circumstances.
Lusias masters the details, looks up the laws on the
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
question, and studies his client’s age, character, and so
forth. He then writes a speech sufficiently dramatised
to come naturally from Mantitheos’ mouth. In composing
it he will simulate the indignation which he
supposes his client to feel, he will adopt the nonchalant
air of injured innocence which Mantitheos showed in
telling the story, and so on, till the speech is a real
bit of dramatisation like the speeches in a tragedy.
When composed, the speech would be carried off by
Mantitheos, learnt by heart, and duly recited. It is
all a bit of acting on Lusias’ part. The habit of
simulating feelings when writing speeches was dangerous,
when the logographos came forward to speak in his
own person on some question. Demosthenes never
quite escapes the suspicion of acting and posing, even
in his most impressive moments.</p>

<p>Besides these clients, the Athenian lawyers had
permanent pupils, who either intended to be lawyers
themselves or thought the study would help them in
a political life. Their methods of teaching, as may
be seen from Plato’s <cite>Phaidros</cite>, resembled those of
Isokrates. In the dialogue called by his name, Phaidros
is going out to walk off the effects of sitting indoors
too long.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_561" id="fnanchor_561"></a><a href="#footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></span>
He had been listening to Lusias, “the
cleverest speech-writer of the age,” reciting one of his
speeches, on which he had spent much labour. Phaidros
had made him repeat it several times, and has now
borrowed the book in order to learn it by heart during
his walk. Sokrates persuades him to read it aloud, in
doing which he is quite carried away by its eloquence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_562" id="fnanchor_562"></a><a href="#footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></span>
Sokrates then proceeds to criticise the style and
matter of the speech,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_563" id="fnanchor_563"></a><a href="#footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></span>
and to compose one of his
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
own on the same subject to show how it ought to be
treated.</p>

<p>This reveals the method of teaching. The teacher,
as here and in Isokrates’ case, recites a speech of his
own, explaining how it was done and asking for
criticism from the pupils. Then the pupil would learn
it by heart and declaim it in some solitary place. On
other occasions, as Sokrates does here, the master would
take the speech of some rival professor and criticise it
severely, composing a better speech himself. The
<cite>Bousiris</cite> and <cite>Helen</cite> of Isokrates show this method.
Or else the pupil replied to the teacher, or the
teacher wrote two speeches on opposite sides of the
question. The extant work of Antiphon and the lost
work of Gorgias<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_564" id="fnanchor_564"></a><a href="#footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></span>
are of this type.</p>

<p>Most of the Attic orators seem to have taken pupils.
Isaios taught Demosthenes. Demosthenes in his turn
seems to have had great popularity as a teacher. He
“promises to teach young men the art of speaking”;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_565" id="fnanchor_565"></a><a href="#footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></span>
“he filled Aristarchos with empty hopes of becoming
the prince of orators all in a moment”;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_566" id="fnanchor_566"></a><a href="#footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></span>
 “he invited
some of his pupils to come and listen to the speech
<cite>On the False Embassy</cite>, promising to show them how to
cheat and mislead the audience”;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_567" id="fnanchor_567"></a><a href="#footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></span>
 “later on he will
brag before his boys of his tricks.” These passages
give an interesting picture of Demosthenes and
his pupils, as seen through his opponent’s green
spectacles.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>In opposition to the schools of Rhetoric stood the
schools of Philosophy, leading their pupils towards the
life of retirement and contemplation and away from the
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
strenuous life of political and social activity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_568" id="fnanchor_568"></a><a href="#footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></span>
We
have seen that there were many professors of Philosophy
at Athens in Isokrates’ time, charging fees of three or four
mnai for their course. But only one of them is known
to posterity, and he gave lessons gratis. Otherwise,
Plato must be taken as a member of a class, albeit the
most brilliant member. The teaching of Plato centred,
as is well known, round the Akademeia. Plato possessed
a house and garden, which he bequeathed to his school,
between that gymnasium and Kolonos. When he and
his pupils wished to be private they could withdraw into
his gardens; otherwise they frequented the Akademeia,
from which their school took its name. It was not
every one who could obtain admission to the school,
for, as Plato taught gratuitously, he could pick and
choose his pupils. He expected would-be students to
be well grounded in Geometry: there must have been
some sort of entrance-examination. His successor,
Xenokrates, finding that an applicant was ignorant of
Music, Geometry, and Astronomy, told him to go away:
“for you give philosophy no chance of getting a grip
upon you.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_569" id="fnanchor_569"></a><a href="#footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></span>
The inner circle of the school had their
meals in common: the banquets were extremely plain.
Timotheos, the Athenian general, who was accustomed
to rich living, after having been a guest at one of these
meals, remarked, on meeting Plato next day, “Your
suppers are more pleasant on the following day than
they are at the time.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_570" id="fnanchor_570"></a><a href="#footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></span>
After the meal, a larger
number of friends probably came in; this, at any rate,
was a custom at the similar meetings held by the
philosopher Menedemos a generation later.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_571" id="fnanchor_571"></a><a href="#footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></span>
The discourse
often went on all night. There was a fixed code
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
of rules to regulate these meals,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_572" id="fnanchor_572"></a><a href="#footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></span>
which is suggestive of
Plato’s pleasantries in the <cite>Laws</cite> about the educational
value of strictly regulated bouts of intoxication. But
drunkenness was, of course, not allowed: Plato had a
particular objection to it, and used to tell drunkards to
look in the looking-glass and they would never err in
that way again.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_573" id="fnanchor_573"></a><a href="#footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></span>
It offended his strict canons of
physical beauty and propriety. It is interesting to note
that the author of the <cite>Republic</cite> admitted women on
terms of equality to this inner circle of the Akademeia,
in defiance of Athenian prejudice. Lastheneia of
Mantineia and Axiothea of Phlious, who dressed in
male attire, are the first champions of women’s rights
to a University education who appear in history.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_574" id="fnanchor_574"></a><a href="#footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></span>
The
discussions of this clique were probably conducted after
the model of the Platonic dialogue, and doubtless were
in Plato’s mind when in the <cite>Laws</cite> he constructed
his curious ethical and political debating-society for the
older and wiser members of his state.</p>

<p>But admission to these mysteries must have been
reserved for comparatively few, personal friends and
mature thinkers: the members formed rather a private
club than an educational system. The young Athenian
who wished, when his primary education was finished,
to study philosophy under Plato, had two means open
to him: there were lectures in various public places;
there was also a school for lads in the Akademeia.</p>

<p>The only lecture,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_575" id="fnanchor_575"></a><a href="#footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></span>
of which any very definite trace
is left, was not a great success from the educational
point of view. Plato announced beforehand that
his subject would be “The Good.” A great crowd
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
collected, expecting to hear a neat Isocratean discussion
of such things as Health, Wealth, Friendship, which
were popularly considered to be rival claimants for the
title of the Good. But Plato began to talk about
arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, and discussed
the One as the Good. The whole lecture was couched
in enigmatical language. The majority of the audience
went away in despair.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_576" id="fnanchor_576"></a><a href="#footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></span>
Only practised Platonists like
Aristotle and Herakleides and Hestiaios did their best
to understand the lecture, and took notes. The whole
idea of a “popular lecture” must have been repugnant
to Plato. In his view, knowledge was only for the few,
who, starting with great natural abilities, could devote
themselves for years at a time to continual study and
research. The pupil must be talented to start with:
he must undergo a long course of preparatory studies
in Logic and Mathematics: only when middle-aged
might he approach the inner mysteries of Philosophy.
Holding such educational ideas as these, Plato naturally
made his lectures unintelligible to all but a few: his
main subject for public exposition seems to have been
that curious mathematical metaphysic which Aristotle
combats as Platonic, although it is nowhere found in
the extant dialogues. By reading the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> of
Aristotle the modern inquirer can perhaps realise how
difficult Plato’s lectures must have been.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_577" id="fnanchor_577"></a><a href="#footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></span>
</p>

<p>At the school in the Akademeia, Plato seems to have
instructed his lads chiefly in Logic and Mathematics.
Logic consisted chiefly of definitions, such as those for
which Sokrates was always hunting, and that curious
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
process of “division” which is exemplified at such
length in the <cite>Sophist</cite> and <cite>Politikos</cite>. Diogenes
Laertius<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_578" id="fnanchor_578"></a><a href="#footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></span>
gives a long catalogue of such divisions, of
which only a few can be found in extant works: the
rest must have figured in the school, and survived as
traditions in the commentaries. A comic poet has left
a picture of the logic school at work<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_579" id="fnanchor_579"></a><a href="#footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="decoration">A.</span> What of Plato and Speusippos and Menedemos?
Upon what are they now engaged? What is their
thought? What argument is investigated among them?
Tell me, I pray, if you know.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="decoration">B.</span> I can tell you clearly. For at the Panathenaia
I saw a herd (<ins title="agelê">ἀγέλη</ins>: note the Spartan word) of lads
in the gymnasium of the Akademeia, and listened to
strange, portentous arguments. They were drawing
up definitions about natural history. They separated
the life of animals and the nature of trees and the tribes
of vegetables: then, among these last, they inquired to
what tribe the cucumber belonged.… First of all
they stood speechless, and, putting their heads down,
thought for a long time. Then suddenly, while the
lads still had their heads down, and were thinking, one
of them said it was a circular vegetable, another declared
that it was a herb, another suggested a tree. A Sicilian
Doctor who was present ridiculed them most rudely.
But the lads took no notice; and Plato, very gently
and without losing his temper at all, told them to try
again to define the species to which it belonged. So
they began their divisions again.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Sophist</cite> the mysterious stranger divides
Art into (1) creative or productive, (2) acquisitive.
Then acquisitive art into (1) acquisition by exchange,
(2) acquisition by capture. Then the art which acquires
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
its object by capture is divided into public or competitive
and secret or hunting. Then, when hunting has been
duly divided and subdivided, a definition of angling is
obtained. In the parody by Epikrates, the same process
is employed in order to define “cucumber,” although
the stages are, of course, confused. A cucumber is a
form of life. Life is divided into animals and vegetation:
vegetation into trees and vegetables. Then the
doubt arises, to which half does the cucumber belong.
Some of the pupils say it is a vegetable, some a tree.
So the lesson begins again.</p>

<p>Plato’s pupils seem to have been expected to take
great care of their personal appearance: their neatness
is a common butt of contemporary comedians<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_580" id="fnanchor_580"></a><a href="#footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Of discipline in the Akademeia under Plato nothing
is known: the following story<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_586" id="fnanchor_586"></a><a href="#footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></span>
belongs to the school
a little after his death. A certain Polemon agreed with
some young friends of his, who attended the school,
that he would rush into the room during the lesson,
drunk and garlanded. This he carried out. But the
teacher, Xenokrates, went calmly on with his lecture,
which happened to deal with Sobriety. This conduct
quite overcame Polemon, and he became a most diligent
pupil, and finally succeeded Xenokrates as teacher.</p>

<p class="unindent">Additional evidence is given by his efforts on behalf of
Dionusios and Dion, which led him into so many perils
in Sicily.</p>

<p>Plato was teaching in Athens almost continually
from 388 till 347. His pupils included, no doubt, many
of the chief men of the day: Chabrias, Iphikrates,
Hupereides, Phokion, Lukourgos, and Demosthenes
are mentioned, besides the philosophers Speusippos,
Xenokrates, Herakleides of Pontos, and Aristotle.
But posterity ascribed pupils recklessly to all the great
teachers of antiquity, so the catalogue carries little
weight. It is interesting to observe that the school as
a whole was attacked for producing tyrants: the bitter
description of the miseries of tyranny in the <cite>Republic</cite>
are at once a sad reflection upon former pupils and a
warning to those whom he was instructing at the time.
But the Philosopher-king, who embodied Plato’s ideal
form of Government, may well have had a corrupting
influence upon the pupils. Dion, the philosopher and
patriot who became a tyrant, is an interesting commentary

<p>Teaching in the Akademeia was given gratuitously;
but those who were so disposed might give presents to
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
their teacher. Dionusios presented Plato with over
80 talents.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_588" id="fnanchor_588"></a><a href="#footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></span>

<p>The school of Aristotle in the Lukeion differed
little in its methods from the school of Plato in the
Akademeia. He had been a pupil of Plato for twenty
years before he began to teach on his own account.
He used to give instruction walking up and down in
the walks of the Lukeion. In his earlier period, at any
rate, he seems to have taught rhetoric, and taught it in
Isocratean fashion: we hear of him setting a theme,
on which he and the pupils delivered harangues “in
rhetorical fashion.” Later the school became a home
of universal knowledge and research; in this respect
Aristotle is the heir of the much-abused Sophists. He
adopted Xenokrates’ custom of appointing one of the
pupils to be Archon of the school for ten days, and
then another: this system must have relieved him of
much petty business.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_589" id="fnanchor_589"></a><a href="#footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></span>
He delivered two courses of
lectures daily: one in the morning on abstruse subjects
to picked pupils; and the other in the afternoon, open
to all comers and more intelligible in matter and manner.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_590" id="fnanchor_590"></a><a href="#footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></span>
His fame as a teacher was sufficient to win him the
honour of being chosen to be Alexander’s tutor, and
he seems to have retained his pupil’s respect, if not
perhaps his affection. Aristotle, dreaming of a tiny
city-state, and Alexander, dreaming of a world-empire
and carrying out his dream, are an ill-assorted pair.
What would Plato have given for the chance of
educating such a Philosopher-king?</p>

<p>That there were bitter feuds between the various
educational leaders in Athens, goes without saying. A

Hellene could no more brook a rival than could an
Italian of the Renaissance. Isokrates attacks Plato,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_591" id="fnanchor_591"></a><a href="#footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></span>
Plato Isokrates, and then their pupils take the quarrel
on into the next generation. Both attack with equal
animus the wandering Sophists and the Eristics, who
retaliated with vigour. A would-be pupil must have
found it hard to choose a professor under whom to
study, when so much evil had been spoken of them all.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_592" id="fnanchor_592"></a><a href="#footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>The schools of Rhetoric and of Philosophy were
only for the rich and the leisured classes: the poor had
neither the time nor the money requisite for attending
them. But they were not wholly debarred from the
higher knowledge. There were still Sophists lecturing
for advertisement in public places. Still more, there
were books, which were beginning to be both numerous
and cheap: every Athenian could read. How important
a part books were beginning to take in national
education may be seen from the works of Isokrates and
Plato, who are both excessively indignant at the intrusion
of such a rival.</p>

<p>“I know that what is read has less power of persuasion
than what is heard. It is universally believed that
a speech, if actually delivered, deals with serious and
important subjects; but if only written and never
spoken, it is supposed to aim merely at effect and the
fulfilment of a contract. This opinion is quite reasonable.
For the written speech is deprived of the prestige
of the author’s presence and of his voice and of the
proper rhetorical delivery: it is read when the occasion
which called it forth is past, and the points which it
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
discusses are consequently less interesting. The slave
who reads it aloud puts no character into it, but drones
it out as though he were reckoning up the items of a
bill.” Such is Isokrates’ view, somewhat freely translated,
of “the written word,” which his shyness
compelled him to use instead of the spoken, and he
beseeches Philip of Macedon, whom he is addressing,
to put aside the usual prejudice against writings.</p>

<p>Plato regarded the written word with even greater
contempt. To him it is the cause of forgetfulness;
those who employ writing learn to rely on their notes,
not on their memory, and are accustomed to register
their impressions on tables of wax, not of the mind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_593" id="fnanchor_593"></a><a href="#footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></span>
Again, it is impossible for an author to control the
circulation of his works; they may reach those for
whom they are not intended.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_594" id="fnanchor_594"></a><a href="#footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></span>
For Plato expects
speaker and writer alike to express only what is suitable
to their audience; the teacher must, by a study of
psychology, know what arguments will do good and
what will do harm to each particular pupil. But a
book cannot impart knowledge, in the Platonic sense
of the word, at all; for it is unable to answer questions
or to explain its author’s meaning when the reader fails
to follow.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_595" id="fnanchor_595"></a><a href="#footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></span>
Comprehension of a fact or of a statement
made on a writer’s authority, without comprehension
of the meaning and the explanation, is not knowledge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_596" id="fnanchor_596"></a><a href="#footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></span>
Consequently, not even a lecture<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_597" id="fnanchor_597"></a><a href="#footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></span>
or a sermon, far less
a book whose author is absent or dead, can impart
knowledge; to gain this, long study and a severe course
of dialectic are essential. The possessor of true knowledge
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
must be able to defend his view against any
opposing arguments and to support it by discussion
himself:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_598" id="fnanchor_598"></a><a href="#footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></span>
neither book nor lecture can give this intimate
acquaintance with every point of view. Moreover,
teaching is like agriculture. There are different soils
and different minds. The seed of knowledge will bear
different fruit in different soils, and there are types of
minds in which some particular seeds must not be sown
at all. Thus the same teacher will produce quite
different philosophical results in different minds: just
as Sokrates did with his various pupils. It is the
development of the individual intellect and aptitudes
of each pupil, not the inculcation of his own theories,
that is the teacher’s true object.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_599" id="fnanchor_599"></a><a href="#footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></span>
Consequently, even
a consistent scheme of dogmas is wrong for educational
purposes; for it may suit the intellect of the teacher
himself, but it cannot suit all his pupils.</p>

<p>Hence, in order to be consistent with his own
educational ideals, Plato makes his works inconsistent:
they are not a body of rigid dogmas. Also, he provides
in them just that discussion which he notes as lacking
in most books; it is possible to ask his books a certain
number of questions, for he anticipates and answers
them himself in the dialogue. In this way he makes
his words pass through the alembic<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_600" id="fnanchor_600"></a><a href="#footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></span>
of each pupil’s
brain, and come out according to the type of mind
through which they have passed. There is no enforcement
of authority in true Platonism.</p>

<p>Plato refused to publish any philosophy in his own
name. By speaking through the mouth of others, he
could vary his attitudes just as he wished. The written
word, he declares, must necessarily contain much trifling.
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>

Its one use is that it serves to remind the writer of
what he knows already, when the forgetfulness of old
age comes upon him. But the writer is quite worthless
if he possesses nothing better in his mind than what
he has written on paper,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_602" id="fnanchor_602"></a><a href="#footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></span>

<p>Books, however, were already serious rivals to
personal intercourse, as a means of education. The
libraries founded by Peisistratos at Athens and by
Polukrates at Samos were, it is true, almost certainly
fabulous; for Euripides was satirised for possessing a
collection of books, so it must have been a novelty in
his time. Books were probably very rare before the
Periclean age, but then they multiplied with great
rapidity. The children used them in the schools.
Schoolmasters were expected to possess them: Alkibiades
beat one for not having a copy of Homer. The
comic poet Alexis makes Herakles’ master, Linos, possess
copies of Orpheus, Hesiod, the tragedians, Choirilos,
Homer, Epicharmos, and all sorts of prose works, including
a cookery-book. A cargo of books was wrecked at
Salmudessos,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_604" id="fnanchor_604"></a><a href="#footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></span>
a fact which points to a large book-trade
in Hellenic waters. Euthudemos, the companion of
Sokrates, possessed a fine collection of the best-known
poets and Sophists, including the works of Homer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_605" id="fnanchor_605"></a><a href="#footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></span>
Sokrates suggests that he may be collecting his books
in order to learn Medicine, on which subject there
were many treatises, or Architecture or Geometry or
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
Astronomy. This shows how handbooks dealing with
all manner of subjects were multiplying.</p>

<p>Xenophon’s treatise on <cite>The Horse</cite> had been preceded
by a similar work by Simon;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_606" id="fnanchor_606"></a><a href="#footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></span>
he himself also
wrote on <cite>Hunting</cite>, on <cite>The Duties of a Cavalry Officer</cite>,
on <cite>The Management of a Farm</cite>, and <cite>The Constitution
of Sparta</cite>, besides his more definitely historical and
philosophical works. His <cite>Education of Kuros</cite> conceals
a treatise on the duties of a general. The subjects are
significant of the new movement; for earlier Hellenes
had supposed that Homer and Hesiod taught the whole
art of agriculture and generalship. Other agricultural
treatises, containing much theory but very little practical
knowledge, were also in circulation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_607" id="fnanchor_607"></a><a href="#footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></span>
Later in the
fourth century Aineias the Tactician contributed a
manual for generals. Medical treatises emanated in
great numbers from the school of Hippokrates, and
probably from elsewhere. Chares and Apollodoros
published works on Husbandry,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_608" id="fnanchor_608"></a><a href="#footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></span>

Books of travels and geography are also
mentioned by Aristotle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_610" id="fnanchor_610"></a><a href="#footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></span>
Handbooks on “Rhetoric”
were first compiled by Korax and Tisias: they dealt
with the subject of “arguments from probability.”
Show pieces were written by Antiphon and Gorgias. A
treatise by Polos upon the systematic arrangement of a
speech was read by Sokrates. Thrasumachos published
a work upon <cite>Appeals to Compassion</cite>.</p>

<p>The prices were probably not high, for the labour of
copying could be cheaply performed by means of slaves.
Sokrates, in the Platonic Apology,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_611" id="fnanchor_611"></a><a href="#footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></span>
mentions that a
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
copy of Anaxagoras could sometimes be picked up for
a drachma; and there is no reason to suppose that
Anaxagoras was particularly cheap. If this was an
average price, books must have been within the reach
of most Athenians.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">TERTIARY EDUCATION</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">When</span> he reached eighteen years, the young Athenian
partly came of age. His property passed into his
possession, if he had been a ward, and he could now
prosecute his guardians if they had defrauded him.
But he could not appear in any other sort of lawsuit,
or take part in the National Assembly, nor could he
be taxed, till he was twenty.</p>

<p>First of all, his deme or parish had to examine him
to see if he was of proper parentage and of the requisite
age.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_612" id="fnanchor_612"></a><a href="#footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></span>
If they rejected him, the case came before the
regular Court of Athens. In the event of being
again rejected, if it was on the score of age, he returned
to the ranks of the boys to wait a further trial, but
if on the score of parentage, he might be sold as a
slave and his price put into the Treasury. If his deme
accepted him he was again examined by the Boule of
500 at Athens, who might rescind their decision.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_613" id="fnanchor_613"></a><a href="#footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></span>
</p>

<p>When he had passed all these preliminary examinations,
the boy was inscribed upon the roll of his deme,
the <ins title="lêxiarchikon grammateion">ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματεῖον</ins>, and became in the eyes of
the law an ephebos. It was then incumbent upon him
to take a solemn oath in the temple of Aglauros, in
the following terms<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_614" id="fnanchor_614"></a><a href="#footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
“I will not disgrace my sacred weapons nor desert
the comrade who is placed by my side. I will fight for
things holy and things profane, whether I am alone or
with others. I will hand on my fatherland greater and
better than I found it. I will hearken to the magistrates,
and obey the existing laws and those hereafter
established<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_615" id="fnanchor_615"></a><a href="#footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></span>
by the people. I will not consent unto any
that destroys or disobeys the constitution, but will
prevent him, whether I am alone or with others. I
will honour the temples and the religion which my forefathers
established. So help me Aglauros, Enualios,
Ares, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo, Hegemone.”</p>

<p>This oath and ceremony must be ancient. The
orator Lukourgos<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_616" id="fnanchor_616"></a><a href="#footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></span>
includes them among “the ancient
laws and customs of the original founders,” and claims
that the oath of the Hellenic army at Plataea in 479
was imitated from the oath of the Athenian epheboi.
By this solemn act the ephebos accepted the duties and
responsibilities of an Athenian citizen. So in Plato’s
dialogue, the <cite>Kriton</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_617" id="fnanchor_617"></a><a href="#footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></span>
where the Laws of Athens are
introduced as pleading their cause, they say, “When
any one has passed his examination, and has seen the
constitution of the city and us, the Laws of Athens, we
bid him, if he is dissatisfied with us, to take what is his
and go whither he pleases. But if he stays, we consider
that he has promised to obey us.” For there is good
evidence, besides that which is afforded by the above
passage, to show that Athenian boys were taught what
the laws of their city were, before they promised to
obey them. Thus Aischines says: “When any one is
inscribed upon the muster roll of his deme and knows
the laws of the city.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_618" id="fnanchor_618"></a><a href="#footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></span>
Plato puts it even more
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
definitely: “When the children leave school,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_619" id="fnanchor_619"></a><a href="#footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></span>
the city
compels them to learn the laws.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_620" id="fnanchor_620"></a><a href="#footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></span>
So the ephebos
knew what he was doing when he swore to obey the
law of the land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tribes had met and each chosen three
men of over forty years of age, from whom the
assembled people elected one, to look after the epheboi
of each tribe.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_621" id="fnanchor_621"></a><a href="#footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></span>
These supervisors were called Sophronistai
or Moderators. That these Moderators probably
dated back to Solonic times, and possessed a general,
but rarely exercised, supervision over all education, I
have endeavoured to show in Chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Their
province was the morality and discipline of the epheboi,
whose military training was naturally controlled by the
military officers, the Generals and Taxiarchoi; later,
however, when the epheboi ceased to be a military body,
these latter functionaries ceased to have any connection
with them. Towards the close of the fourth century
the people elected a single Kosmetes or Chancellor for
the epheboi; he is first mentioned, if a probably spurious
passage in the <cite>Axiochos</cite> is rejected, in an inscription,
in which he is associated with the epheboi and Moderators
of the year in awarding a crown to Theophanes in the
Archonship of Nikostratos (333-332 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_622" id="fnanchor_622"></a><a href="#footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></span>
But in
280 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, in the list of the officers and masters of the
epheboi, the Kosmetes is mentioned, but no Sophronistai:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_623" id="fnanchor_623"></a><a href="#footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></span>
at that time the epheboi were too few to need
an officer to each tribe.</p>

<p><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
These newly appointed magistrates took the epheboi
of their year in charge at once. The young recruits
were first taken round the temples, and then put into
garrison in Mounuchia and Peiraieus. They had masters
and under-masters appointed for them by the Sophronistai
to teach them the use of heavy arms, and also of the
bow, javelin, and catapult. There were also two Paidotribai,
for gymnastics. These masters, together with
later introductions such as literary teachers, chaplains,
doctors, and so forth, appear regularly in the inscriptions
after 300 <span class="sc">B.C.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_624" id="fnanchor_624"></a><a href="#footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></span>
The Sophronistai were paid a drachma
a day for their services. They also received four obols
for every ephebos in their tribe, out of which they had
to provide the rations, etc.; the ephebos did not handle
the money himself. Each tribe messed together.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_625" id="fnanchor_625"></a><a href="#footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Besides the Sophronistai and Kosmetes, the Council
of the Areiopagos also kept a watch over the epheboi.
Discipline seems to have been fairly strict: the
<cite>Axiochos</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_626" id="fnanchor_626"></a><a href="#footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></span>
talks of “rods and immensities of evils.”
But there were plenty of amusements, and, apparently,
plenty of vacations. There were a very large number
of special festivals, in which the epheboi took part.
There were also the torch-races at the feasts of Hephaistos
and Prometheus, for teams of epheboi from each tribe,
trained at the expense of a gumnasiarchos. The epheboi
had also a special part of the theatre reserved for them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_627" id="fnanchor_627"></a><a href="#footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></span>
</p>

<p>No doubt a large part of the time of these epheboi
was spent in severe physical exercise in the gymnasia.
The analogy of the epheboi in Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite> and
<cite>Laws</cite> would suggest this. The <cite>Axiochos</cite> mentions,
as consequent upon enrolment in the epheboi, “the
Lukeion and Akademeia,” <span class="decoration">i.e.</span> practices in these
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
gymnasia. Xenophon,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_628" id="fnanchor_628"></a><a href="#footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></span>
just before mentioning the
“peripoloi” or epheboi in their second year, talks of
“those who are ordered to practise gymnastic exercises,”
clearly referring to this period. He suggests
that their duties would be better and more cheerfully
performed if they received a larger supply of rations
than those who were training for torch-races; to these
latter no doubt a liberal gumnasiarchos might serve
out meals costing much more than four obols a day.
Probably those who were physically inferior alone were
told off for these compulsory gymnastics: Xenophon’s
phrase seems to distinguish them from the epheboi
selected for the torch-race, who would naturally be the
physically fittest in the tribal contingent.</p>

<p>At the end of their first year of training, the epheboi
appeared in the theatre at the great Dionusia to show
off their military evolutions and the drill which they
had learned. After the review they received a spear
and shield from the State.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_629" id="fnanchor_629"></a><a href="#footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></span>
The sons of those who
had fallen in battle, being the wards of the State,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_630" id="fnanchor_630"></a><a href="#footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></span>
received a complete outfit of armour. These arms,
which the epheboi received from the State, were
considered to be sacred: consequently to throw away
the shield in flight was regarded as a serious offence,
almost an act of sacrilege.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_631" id="fnanchor_631"></a><a href="#footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></span>

<p>After receiving their arms from the State, the
epheboi were marched out of Athens, and spent most
of the next year patrolling the country and frontiers,
and garrisoning the forts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_632" id="fnanchor_632"></a><a href="#footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></span>
Attica was studded with
<!--Blank Page-->
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
these <ins title="peripolia">περιπόλια</ins>, or patrol-stations, from Oinoé and
Phulé on the north-western frontier to Anaphlustos
and Thorikos in the south. The epheboi, like the
<ins title="kryptoi">κρυπτοί</ins> in Plato’s <cite>Laws</cite> and at Sparta, were shifted
about from district to district, in order that they might
acquire a thorough knowledge of their country’s
geographical peculiarities. The tribal companies, into
which they were divided, relieved one another in various
stations. Thus in the course of 334-333 we know
that both the Hippothontid and the Kekropid tribes
were successively stationed at Eleusis, for the people
of that district pass two separate votes of thanks to
them for the excellent discipline which they had
preserved.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_633" id="fnanchor_633"></a><a href="#footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></span>
There may also have been open-air
camps: the Eleusinian inscriptions talk of <ins title="hypaithrioi">ὑπαίθριοι</ins>.</p>

<p>The epheboi seem to have been assisted in their
patrol-duties by a mercenary force of foreigners.
Thucydides<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_634" id="fnanchor_634"></a><a href="#footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></span>
declares that Phrunichos was assassinated
by a peripolos: the Athenian people, according to
Lusias, rewarded Thrasuboulos of Kaludon as the
slayer and recorded his name on a pillar.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_635" id="fnanchor_635"></a><a href="#footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></span>
If the
historian had meant to dispute this award, he must have
referred to it, for it was clearly the accepted version.
He also states that the plot was arranged at the house
of the captain of the peripoloi, and mentions an
Argive as one of the accomplices: Lusias mentions
a Megarian. Both these foreigners were probably
peripoloi. But foreign youths cannot at this period
have been permitted to serve with the tribal companies
of epheboi. A legend, it is true, asserts that this
privilege was granted to the young men of Kos, in
honour of the great doctor Hippokrates; but even
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
this only shows that all other states were excluded.
Indeed, foreigners were not enrolled among the
Athenian epheboi until a much later epoch, when the
system was no longer military.</p>

<p>What, then, was this “Foreign Legion”? M.
Girard identifies it with the Mounted Archers, on the
strength of a passage in Aristophanes’ <cite>Birds</cite>. An
unknown deity has invaded the territory of Cloud-Cuckoo
town. Peisthetairos exclaims, “Why didn’t
you despatch peripoloi after him at once?” To which
the messenger replies, “We did send 30,000 Mounted
Archers.” The inscriptions at Eleusis also make a force
of non-citizen troops serve under the captain of the
peripoloi. These mercenary troops, having no civil
duties, would naturally be used as a patrol. Moreover,
to an Athenian, “archer” meant “policeman.”
Athens was policed by foreign “Archers”: it would be
natural for Attica to be policed in like manner, only
by a mounted force, as a greater distance had to be
covered.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_636" id="fnanchor_636"></a><a href="#footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></span>
But it is also possible that the non-Athenian
peripoloi were the sons of <ins title="metoikoi isoteleis">μέτοικοι ἰσοτελεῖς</ins>, who,
being forced to serve as hoplites when grown up, would
require some preliminary training; these alien hoplites
are coupled by Thucydides<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_637" id="fnanchor_637"></a><a href="#footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></span>
with the recruits and
veterans, who garrisoned the Athenian walls and forts:
they seem to have served as a perpetual patrol.</p>

<p>The first three classes of Athenian citizens in wealth
must all have passed through this training; for,
although the two first were liable to cavalry service,
they might also be called upon to serve as hoplites.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_638" id="fnanchor_638"></a><a href="#footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></span>
Rich young epheboi, who had plenty of time on their
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
hands, would naturally learn both cavalry and infantry
drill. The poorer Zeugitai would only have to learn
their duties as heavy infantry, and were probably
allowed to spend a good proportion of their time on
their farms in Athens. But what about the fourth
class, the Thetes? They were not liable to be called
out as hoplites, but had to serve on land as light-armed
troops or at sea as rowers. Did they also have
a recruit course? Now the garrisons of the Athenian
forts and walls were hoplites:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_639" id="fnanchor_639"></a><a href="#footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></span>
there is no trace of the
Thetes here. But the patrol duties in the mountains
can hardly have been performed by heavy troops: it
is noticeable that in Xenophon light troops are
suggested for this purpose, when Sokrates is developing
an elaborate scheme for holding the frontiers of
Attica against all invaders.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_640" id="fnanchor_640"></a><a href="#footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></span>
In the next century, at
any rate, light troops were used for this purpose.
In a later work Xenophon talks of “those who are
ordered to occupy the forts and those who have to
serve as peltasts and patrol the country,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_641" id="fnanchor_641"></a><a href="#footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></span>
in a passage
where he is clearly referring to the epheboi. Thus
there are two classes, the garrisons, who would
naturally be hoplites, and the patrols, who are peltasts,
suitably equipped for mountaineering. But the peltasts
only began to appear towards the close of the Peloponnesian
War: the first mention of them is in Thucydides’
account of the army of Brasidas. Before this
time, the light troops were archers and some slingers;
thus, in the monument to those of the Erechtheid tribe
who fell in the year 459, after the hoplites four archers
are mentioned.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_642" id="fnanchor_642"></a><a href="#footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></span>
But they were a small force: there
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
were only 1600 of them in 431 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> The majority
of the Thetes served in the ships. In the <cite>Birds</cite> of
Aristophanes, which appeared in 414, when it was a
question of repelling a sudden raid, just after the
peripoloi have been mentioned, Peisthetairos bids his
immediate attendants arm themselves with slings and
bows: these are clearly the weapons for a flying column
despatched in pursuit of raiders.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_643" id="fnanchor_643"></a><a href="#footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The passage of Xenophon makes it clear that there
were peltasts in the ephebic force in the fourth century;
that of Aristophanes suggests the probability of archers
and slingers among them in the fifth. But whether
these light-armed troops consisted of enterprising
Zeugitai who added this training to their hoplite drill,
or were a small detachment of Thetes, cannot be fixed.
Thetes must, at any rate, not have been numerous in
the ephebic force, for they could not have spared the
time necessary for such lengthy training.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_644" id="fnanchor_644"></a><a href="#footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></span>
</p>

<p>As a rule, the epheboi were not expected to do more
than guard the frontier and repel an occasional foray:
even this, however, must have given them plenty of
employment in war-time. But they shared in Muronides’
great victory in the Megarid in 458, when Athens had
to use her reserves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_645" id="fnanchor_645"></a><a href="#footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></span>
Either they or the “foreign
legion” joined in a later invasion of Megara.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_646" id="fnanchor_646"></a><a href="#footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></span>
But
as a rule they served for home defence only. Their
recruit-course ended with their twentieth year: henceforth
they were ordinary Athenian citizens and soldiers.</p>

<p>In about 332 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, when Lukourgos delivered his
speech against Leokrates, the old ephebic system seems
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
still to have been in force. The suggestion that
Leokrates might have evaded the ephebic oath is only
rhetorical, for the orator immediately goes on to assume
that he took it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_647" id="fnanchor_647"></a><a href="#footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></span>
In 328, the probable date of Aristotle’s
<cite>Athenian Constitution</cite>, it seems still to have been in
existence, for the philosopher records it as part of the
contemporary regime. The inscriptions support these
authorities. A list of epheboi of the Kekropid tribe
enrolled in 334 is given under the vote of thanks:
the upper part of the list is gone, but the numbers were
apparently large.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_648" id="fnanchor_648"></a><a href="#footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></span>
Some forty-four names can be inferred
from the fragments, belonging to six or seven
demes out of the twelve which composed the tribe; but
apparently the smallest contingents are at the bottom,
so there may well have been a hundred names in the
tribe, and 1000 epheboi altogether. Considering the
impoverishment of Attica and the consequent decrease
in the hoplite classes, this is probably a fair proportion
of epheboi.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_649" id="fnanchor_649"></a><a href="#footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></span>
A tribal contingent is still large enough
to serve as a garrison for Eleusis, and to act by itself.</p>

<p>But in the next century the numbers drop down to
twenty-nine and twenty-three. The service must have
been voluntary. Moreover, brothers are found serving
together, from which it may be inferred that the exact
age qualification was no longer regarded.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_650" id="fnanchor_650"></a><a href="#footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></span>
Philosophy
and literature become subjects of study; and a
library, swollen by gifts from old epheboi, is collected.
Foreigners begin to be enrolled in the second century,
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
and in course of time outnumber the native Athenians.
Although the old military service is preserved, no doubt
in a mummified condition, the system of the epheboi
develops into the Athenian university, where young
Romans like Cicero’s son came to learn philosophy,
though they had little to learn from Athens in military
matters. The Sophronistai and Kosmetes become the
Proctors and Chancellor, the special festivals the compulsory
services, of the new University. The torch-races,
the military duties, and the naval races<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_651" id="fnanchor_651"></a><a href="#footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></span>
become
its athletics. It is the old conscription system of
Athens, not the schools of Plato or Isokrates, that
gives birth to the first University.</p>

<p>The system of epheboi was represented at Sparta
by the κρυπτοί [kryptoi]. We hear of an archephebos at Argos,
and a gumnasiarchos who manages the epheboi at
Troizen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_652" id="fnanchor_652"></a><a href="#footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></span>
In the Megarid and in Boiotia the epheboi
were trained as cavalry, hoplites, or peltasts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_653" id="fnanchor_653"></a><a href="#footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></span>
An
ephebarchos can be traced in Teos. There were
patrol-houses, and so possibly epheboi patrols in the
territory of Syracuse.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_654" id="fnanchor_654"></a><a href="#footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></span>
This period of special training
for military duties seems to have been general all over
Hellas. Plato adopts it without demur in the <cite>Republic</cite>
and <cite>Laws</cite>.</p>

peripolos or patrol. Aischines, however, claims to have served two years as a

In 431 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Athens had 13,000 hoplites of between twenty and forty years of

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">RELIGION AND EDUCATION IN HELLAS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> greater part of the religious instruction in Hellas
was given outside the schools, in the home and in public
life. The child learnt the current ritual observances
proper to each particular deity or occasion by participating
in them himself. His religious devotion was
practised and stimulated by the festivals and sacred
songs and dances which made up so large a part of
Hellenic life. In a religion like the Hellenic, which
was so largely a matter of forms and ceremonies, there
was little dogma to be learnt by children; no catechism,
no sectarian teaching was necessary. Such dogma as
there was consisted in the myths which were current
about the various deities and heroes; and of these
myths there were so many varieties that heterodoxy
about them became almost impossible.</p>

<p>Such as it was, this dogma, consisting of manifold
and often contradictory myths, was enshrined in the
poetry of the race, so that most of the poems became
sacred books, regarded by the orthodox as inspired.
This sacred literature, as we have seen, was the chief
object of study in the primary schools at Athens, where
it was read, written, and learnt by heart. At Sparta
almost the whole of literary and intellectual education
consisted of sacred songs in honour of gods and heroes.
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
The myths were the very essence of primary education
in Hellas.</p>

<p>In order to understand the attitude of the educational
theorists towards these myths which run through
most of the Hellenic poetry, it is necessary to
realise the extraordinary authority which was given to
the poets, and especially to Homer and Hesiod. Every
word of them was regarded as inspired and strictly
true: their authority was indisputable. At the beginning
of the sixth century an interpolated line in the
<cite>Iliad</cite> was made the main support of the Athenian
claim to the Island of Salamis. Gelon, the tyrant of
Syracuse, according to the current legend, was refused
the command of the Hellenic forces against Persia
because, as the Spartan envoy put it, Agamemnon
would groan if he heard of such a thing, and because
Homer had said that an Athenian was the best man at
drawing up and marshalling a host, for which cause the
Athenians now claimed the command.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_655" id="fnanchor_655"></a><a href="#footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></span>
That such
arguments could be employed shows in what veneration
Homer was held. He was considered to be especially
inspired.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_656" id="fnanchor_656"></a><a href="#footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></span>
His admirers asserted that he had educated
Hellas, and that his works provided fit instruction for
the whole conduct of life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_657" id="fnanchor_657"></a><a href="#footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></span>
More specifically, it was said
that “The divine Homer won his glory and renown
from this, that he taught good things, drill, valour and
the arming of troops.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_658" id="fnanchor_658"></a><a href="#footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></span>
He was misquoted to support
peculiar views, as in Plato.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_659" id="fnanchor_659"></a><a href="#footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></span>
People had their favourite
texts: Sokrates’ was “In due proportion to thy means
pay honour to the gods.” It was a not unheard-of accomplishment
to know the whole <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite> by heart.
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
Moral lessons were drawn from them. Thus the story
of Kirké was a warning against self-indulgence. Kirké
made the companions of Odusseus swine through their
over-indulgence in the pleasures of the table; Odusseus
himself, by Hermes’ advice and his own self-restraint
in such matters, escaped this fate.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_660" id="fnanchor_660"></a><a href="#footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In time, however, the higher morality of the leading
Hellenic thinkers revolted against the low morality, to
say nothing more, of much of the mythology embodied
in the poets. Xenophanes began the attack.
“Homer and Hesiod,” he cries, “ascribed to the
gods all that is considered disgraceful among men.”
Herakleitos declared that Homer deserved a thrashing.
Even the pious Pindar tried to alter some of the myths
to suit his own morality, and Aeschylus fights hard
for an underlying monotheism. In the next generation
the storm broke: awakening intelligence, fostered
by the Sophists and the philosophers, shrank away
from the horrors of the <cite>Theogony</cite>. Tragedy, by
bringing mythology before the eyes, had made its
impossibility more apparent. The researches of the
earlier historians in comparative mythology had undermined
the bases of belief. Herodotos had found that a
god named Herakles had been recognised in Egypt
17,000 years before his time; consequently the Hellenic
Herakles, only six centuries before the historian’s age,
must be only a man of the same name.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_661" id="fnanchor_661"></a><a href="#footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></span>
Rationalism
began to master the mythology: Thucydides tried to
apply scientific methods to the Trojan War, making, for
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
example, its duration due to the difficulty of obtaining
supplies for so large a force. The rationalism of
Euripides is well known. Metrodoros, a pupil of
Anaxagoras, made the gods natural forces and varieties
of matter&mdash;a device already employed by Empedokles
for poetical convenience. In this way Sokrates
rationalises the Boreas-myth in the <cite>Phaidros</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_662" id="fnanchor_662"></a><a href="#footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></span>
where
Plato states that the wise disbelieve such tales; but
Sokrates was too busy studying his own personality
to raise all these numerous questions, so he accepts
the customary belief. The defenders of Homer, led
by Metrodoros and Stesimbrotos,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_663" id="fnanchor_663"></a><a href="#footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></span>
tried to allegorise
him, declaring that the worst myths had a moral
meaning in the background. The allegories were
often ludicrous: Plato rejects them wholly for educational
purposes, as children always take the literal
interpretation.</p>

<p>But public opinion was still fiercely attached to the
old deities, as the incident of the Hermai and the
condemnation of Anaxagoras, Protagoras, and Sokrates
showed. The deities could not be sacrificed: consequently
it was the myths that had to go. The myths
said that Zeus dethroned his own father and committed
adultery: if the myth is true, since Zeus is Supreme
God, these crimes are justifiable.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_664" id="fnanchor_664"></a><a href="#footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></span>
Therefore the myth
must be untrue. Homer and Hesiod lied: their works
are mainly a blasphemous fiction.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_665" id="fnanchor_665"></a><a href="#footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></span>
Isokrates<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_666" id="fnanchor_666"></a><a href="#footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></span>
sums
up this new attitude. “The poets,” he declares,
“blasphemously represented the sons of the Immortals
as having done and suffered worse deeds than the most
impious of men: they spoke such things about the
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
gods as no one would venture to allege of his worst
enemy; not only do they make them steal, commit
adultery, and fall into slavery to mortals, but even
represent them as eating their children, mutilating their
fathers, and binding their mothers in chains.… For
this the poets did not go unpunished, but some of them
were wanderers and begged their bread, some became
blind, another was an exile all his life long, and Orpheus,
who devoted himself especially to such stories, was torn
in pieces.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_667" id="fnanchor_667"></a><a href="#footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest objection to these immoral legends was
that they were taught in the nursery and the elementary
school, at the most impressionable age.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_668" id="fnanchor_668"></a><a href="#footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></span>
Hence Plato
wishes to lay down strict canons for the myths, legends,
and fables which are to be taught to children. “For
the beginning of everything is half the battle, especially
in the case of what is young and tender. Young
children are like soft wax, ready to take a clear and
deep impression of any seal which is laid upon them.
Hence the immense importance of the earliest stages of
education, the myths and stories taught in the nursery
and at school.… The compositions of Homer and
Hesiod are fiction, and unlovely fiction at that; even
if true, they had better not be told to the young and
undiscerning.… The myths must be improving on
the surface, not by allegory.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_669" id="fnanchor_669"></a><a href="#footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></span></p>

<p>Plato is not prepared to rewrite the Hellenic Bible:
he will only draw up the canons which the poets must
follow. It is to be noticed that these canons are
peculiar, and would exclude not merely most of Homer
and Hesiod, but a large part of the Old and some of
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
the New Testament. The first canon is that God, being
good, cannot be the cause or originator of any harm or
evil to mankind; for these things some other cause
must be discovered. The greater part of the human
lot is evil: so God is not the cause of the majority of
human events.</p>

<p>This excludes Homer’s lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2">Two butts of human fortunes by the gates of Heaven stood,</div>
  <div class="i2">One full of all things evil, and one of all things good.</div>
  <div class="i2">To whom God gives a mixture, his life is weal and woe,</div>
  <div class="i2">But to whom He gives of the evil alone, he lives as a beggar below.</div>

<p class="unindent">And Aeschylus’</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i2">God plants the seed of sin among mankind,</div>
  <div class="i2">Whene’er He wills to bring a race to naught.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>If God is represented as the cause of misfortunes,
the poet must say that the misfortunes were good for
the sufferers, making them better and happier.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_670" id="fnanchor_670"></a><a href="#footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The second canon is that God is not a wizard,
appearing now in one form, now in another. Why
should He change? External forces are not likely to
change Him: He would not change Himself, since it
would necessarily be a transition to the less good and
less beautiful, since He is perfect. So the <span class="lock">lines&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2">Disguised as human strangers, in many a changing guise,</div>
  <div class="i2">Gods roam about the cities, to spy iniquities,</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">and the tales of Proteus and other metamorphoses, are
false. Consequently mothers should not tell their
children that a god may always be present in disguise,
for it is a lie and is also likely to make the children
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
cowardly. Lying is only useful in dealing with enemies,
for managing lunatics, and for making a satisfactory
explanation where certainty is impossible. God has no
such reason for lying or deception.</p>

<p>The character of the Deity having been thus purged
of mythological accretions, Plato passes on to the treatment
of the future state. This must not be described
as in any way terrible, or the children will learn to
prefer dishonourable life to honourable death. So
reject<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">

<p>All such passages must be expurgated from school
editions; nor is it right to admit the fearful scenery of
Hell, the rivers of Hate (Styx) and Wailing (Kokutos),
ghosts, banshees, and other terrible words, for fear of
making the children nervous.</p>

<p>Then comes the discussion of the ideal man, in which
Achilles falls from the pedestal which he had previously
occupied as the ideal of Hellenic manhood. Great men
must not indulge in immoderate lamentations for their
dead friends. The lament of Achilles for Patroklos
and of Priam for Hektor, when he rolled in the dust
and the dungheap, must be rejected. “For if the
young should take such stories seriously and not
laugh them to scorn as contemptibly improbable, they
would be most unlikely to consider such lamentations
degrading, or to check themselves when they felt any
impulse to act in such a way, but, without shame or
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
restraint, they would whine out many dirges over tiny
misfortunes.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_671" id="fnanchor_671"></a><a href="#footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor must the heroes be made too fond of laughing.

grief. So <span class="lock">reject&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Nor must the heroes be allowed to blaspheme. “My
respect for Homer makes me shrink from saying it,
but it is impious to state or to believe that Achilles was
ready to fight against the river, a god, or that he
dragged Hektor’s body round Patroklos’ tomb or
slaughtered captives upon it, or that he gave to the
dead Patroklos the hair which he had dedicated to the
river god Spercheios.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_672" id="fnanchor_672"></a><a href="#footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></span>
Nor must poets say that
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
wicked men are enviable, if they are not found out, or
that justice does good to others but is a loss to oneself.
On the contrary, they must invent myths to establish
the opposite, whether it be true or not, because it is
profitable.</p>

<p>Plato cares very little for literal truth in mythology;
he is only desirous that the fiction should be
improving and in accordance with sound ethics. It
is impossible to know the truth, he thinks, about things
primeval and the gods, so it is necessary to invent stories
as near the truth as possible and such that they will be
improving. The majority of men, as Isokrates also
noticed, prefer myths to anything else; for their intelligence
can only grasp ethical and metaphysical truths
when they are embodied in stories and parables and
fables.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_673" id="fnanchor_673"></a><a href="#footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></span>
These fictions, however, are like powerful drugs:
their concoction must only be entrusted to competent
hands, or the result will be deadly. The rulers of the
State, the philosophers, must construct the national
mythology, not unskilled and irresponsible persons like
poets.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_674" id="fnanchor_674"></a><a href="#footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></span>
Plato himself gives a good many instances
of such profitable myths; he enshrines in them, as in
a popular form, many of his deepest beliefs, his
psychology,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_675" id="fnanchor_675"></a><a href="#footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></span>
his views of the immortality of the soul,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_676" id="fnanchor_676"></a><a href="#footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></span>
his political theory that all men are not equal.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_677" id="fnanchor_677"></a><a href="#footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></span>
In his
opinion mythology was the proper food for the unenlightened

<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
knowledge of ethics and metaphysics, was to concoct
this food.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this theory an ideal character, in
history or fiction, was required to personify and make
real to the multitude the disembodied ideals of Ethics.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_678" id="fnanchor_678"></a><a href="#footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></span>
Achilles had been tumbled from his pedestal by philosophy.
Who was to replace him? Plato tries to
put an idealised Sokrates in this position, but he could
not square the historical personality with the ideal
man postulated in the <cite>Republic</cite>. Xenophon, also
thinking that a pattern man is “an excellent invention
for the study of morality,” proposes Agesilaos.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_679" id="fnanchor_679"></a><a href="#footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></span>
Prodikos tried to make Herakles the model of the
young. Aristotle formulated the <ins title="megalopsychos">μεγαλόψυχος</ins>, but
never personified him. Stoicism sought for its Wise
Man or Perfect Saint, but never found him; Epicureanism
was satisfied with its founder. But the
search for the personification of the ethical ideal becomes
the central feature of Hellenic philosophy and religion
from the time of Plato onwards.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">ART, MUSIC, AND POETRY</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Since</span> poetry, music, singing, and dancing were the
chief components of a Hellenic boy’s education, the
æsthetic canons by which these were regulated came to
be of great importance in the moral history of Hellas,
and were the objects of much thought and inquiry on
the part of the educational theorists. It is hard for a
modern reader to understand the attitude which Plato
and Aristotle adopt towards poetry, art, and music,
partly owing to the way in which these subjects are
neglected in many modern schools, and still more
owing to the immense changes which have taken place
both in the subjects themselves and in their relations
to the State as a whole.</p>

<p>In ancient Hellas art, literature, and music were
addressed to the whole citizen-body, not to a cultured
upper class. The epics were recited to crowds that
might number thousands. The choral lyrics were
danced and sung by large choruses in the presence of a
whole city. Tragedy and Comedy were acted before
the whole Athenian populace, swollen by crowds from
every part of Hellas. The great orations were spoken
either to the national assembly, where every grown
man might be present, or to a jury of several hundred
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
citizens. So with Hellenic art. The statues and
pictures were not created for private drawing-rooms,
but for public temples, colonnades, or gymnasia.</p>

<p>Thus it was national, not individual taste which
was the standard of Hellenic art and literature: they
had to follow the taste of the city, not of a clique. But
every city in Hellas, as in the Italy of the Renaissance,
had an intense individuality of its own, which dominated
its poets, artists, and musicians. The art-schools of
the islands, of Argos, of Athens were as distinct from
one another as those of Venice, Florence, Perugia.
The greater centres had types of music so far distinct
that they required different instruments. Language,
character, and politics in like manner presented a
different aspect in each community. But underneath
this ubiquitous local individuality lay the fundamental
distinction between the Dorian, on the one hand, and the
Ionian, with whom for æsthetic purposes may be classed
the Aeolian, on the other. For Hellenism began to
run its course in two distinct channels, the Doric and
the Ionic.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_680" id="fnanchor_680"></a><a href="#footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The Doric characteristics were the sacrifice of
the detail and the individual to the whole and
the community, a love of terseness and simplicity, a
strong sense of harmony, order, and proportion, a hatred
of complexity, mystery, vagueness, and luxury, and a
preference for the perfect body over the developed
intellect. The Dorians were essentially one-sided, and
lacking in imagination, intellect, and invention; they
were strong conservatives, and any innovation was
repugnant to them.</p>

<p>The Ionians were a very different people. Individualism
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
was strong in them from the first. They
had a tendency to floridity, to exaggeration of detail,
and to luxury. A quick-witted and imaginative race,
they were fond of perpetual innovation. Versatility
was characteristic of them. They preferred intellectual
to physical success. Their imagination outran their
powers of execution. They had none of the solidity
of the less brilliant Dorian, none of his discipline, self-restraint,
directness, or perseverance. They were his
inferiors in most physical and ethical qualities, his
superiors in all intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>Till the fifth century the two conflicting types
exercise little influence upon one another. The Ionians
produce a sensuous, dreamy, refined, and imaginative
sculpture; the Dorians a series of physically excellent
but wholly unintellectual athlete-statues. The Aeolians
produce the personal lyrics of love and wine; the
Dorians the choral poetry of athletic triumphs and
gymnastic dances. The Dorians can claim the ethical
and collectivist philosophy of Pythagoras; the Ionians
the intellectual and individualist philosophy of the so-called
Ionian schools.</p>

<p>Athens during this period was purely Ionic, as her
statues, the remains of which are now being recovered
from the rubbish heaps where Xerxes threw them,
abundantly testify. Further evidence comes from the
style of dress shown in these statues and in other works
of art of the period: it is almost oriental.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_681" id="fnanchor_681"></a><a href="#footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></span>
The statues
reveal an excess of detail and over-refinement: the
most common type was a draped woman. The Dorians,
on the other hand, were most successful in the nude
male type; and the great Aeginetan school quite failed
to represent the goddess Athena.</p>

<p><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
The same principle of differentiation applied to
music as well as to art, in Hellas: the Dorian, the
Ionian, the Aeolian, as well as the neighbouring Phrygian
and Lydian, each produced a type of their own, or
“harmony,” as it was called. Each “harmony” bore the
mark of the “ethos,” or moral character, of the tribe or
race which produced it, plainly and unmistakably. Music
in early Hellas must have been of a primitive type, and
an acute musical ear had not yet been developed by long
training. Consequently, the average Hellenic audience
was in the position of the utterly unmusical man of
modern times: the complicated music of modern masters
would have been wholly unintelligible to them, and the
only meanings which they could extract from music were
certain broad ethical impressions. The unmusical man
is stirred by a good marching tune, moved to a certain
depression by a dirge or dead march, enlivened and
excited by a rollicking bacchanalian song, and reduced
to a solemn and half-religious frame of mind by the
tones of a great organ. So with the average Hellene:
he extracted this amount of impressions from his music,
and no more. Any idea of music as the voice of the
unutterable was quite foreign to his mind; in fact, he
disliked any music that was unaccompanied by singing:
tunes without words were unknown in earlier Hellas.</p>

<p>How these different harmonies were produced, by
what combination of notes and scales each was regulated,
may be left to the specialists: it is one of those
questions which will probably never be settled conclusively.
The fact remains that they existed, each
with an unmistakable moral characteristic of its own.
But what exactly the moral characteristic of each was,
is rendered doubtful by the conflicting evidence of
different writers; probably, as musical taste changed
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
and developed, the same “harmony” came to cause a
different impression. Plato’s ear, accustomed to the
prevalent Dorian, found the Lydian doleful and depressing;
Aristotle and his contemporaries, more used
to softer music, praised it as valuable for educational
purposes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_682" id="fnanchor_682"></a><a href="#footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></span>
Herakleides of Pontos,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_683" id="fnanchor_683"></a><a href="#footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></span>
who made a
special study of music, gives, in a fragment, a sketch
of the old Hellenic “harmonies.” The Dorian,
according to him, was manly, dignified, stern, and
robust, not effeminate nor merry nor variegated nor
versatile.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_684" id="fnanchor_684"></a><a href="#footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></span>
The Aeolic, afterwards called “Hypo-Dorian,”
was haughty and pretentious, rather conceited,
not, however, base in any way, but inflated and
confident. It was the right music for “woman, wine,
and song.” The Ionic, representing the old Ionic
character before the race degenerated, was passionate,
headstrong, contentious, showing no signs of benevolence
or merriment, but revealing a certain hardness of heart
and temperament. It was not florid nor cheerful, but
austere and harsh, with a not ignoble dignity which
fitted it to accompany Tragedy. Later, the race and
the “harmony” seem to have degenerated, and are
charged with being luxurious and effeminate. There
used also to be a Locrian “harmony,” which was used
by Pindar and Simonides, but afterwards it fell into
contempt and died out.</p>

<p>Besides these purely Hellenic types, there were two
which came from barbarian races, the Lydian and the
Phrygian. Of the Lydian there were several varieties.
The Mixed-Lydian was doleful and suitable to dirges:
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
it made the audience feel mournful and grave. The
Syntono-Lydian was very similar. The pure Lydian is
rejected as effeminate by Plato;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_685" id="fnanchor_685"></a><a href="#footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></span>
but Aristotle, resting
on the musical experts, declares that it involves order
and arrangement (<ins title="kosmos">κόσμος</ins>) and is well adapted for
education. About the Phrygian opinion is still more
divided. Plato commends it. According to him it
suitably represents the notes and accents of a self-controlled
man “in peaceful and unconstrained circumstances,
trying to persuade some one or making a
request, praying to a god or advising a man, or giving
his attention to the request or advice or arguments of
some one else; and if he attains his object, not puffed
up, but in all things acting, and accepting the consequences
of his actions, with moderation and self-control.”
The philosopher then goes on to reject
the flute, as suitable only to hysterical enthusiasm.
But this, as Aristotle pointed out, was inconsistent.
For the Phrygian harmony and the flute went hand in
hand: the wild orgies of Dionusos and other worships
of an enthusiastic nature were usually accompanied by
the flute and could only be set to the Phrygian
harmony. The dithyramb, for instance, could only be
set in this way; when Philoxenos definitely tried to
write one to the Dorian, he slid back without being able
to prevent it into the Phrygian. Aristotle therefore,
accounting it an enthusiastic harmony, reserves it as a
“purge” (<ins title="katharsis">κάθαρσις</ins>), which, by providing under well-regulated
conditions an occasional outlet for hysteria, will
work such affections out of the system for a long period:
at the end of which another dose will be required.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_686" id="fnanchor_686"></a><a href="#footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
In Hellas music was held to be an efficacious medicine
for the ills alike of body, soul, and mind. Even the
grave and learned philosopher Theophrastos, the pupil of
Aristotle, asserted that the Phrygian “harmony” on the
flute was the proper means of curing lumbago.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_687" id="fnanchor_687"></a><a href="#footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></span>
Pindar
states that Apollo “gives to men and women cures for
grievous sickness, and invented the harp, and gives the
Muse to whom he will, bringing warless peace into the
heart”:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_688" id="fnanchor_688"></a><a href="#footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></span>
the god of medicine is the son of the god of
the harp. The Pythagorean philosopher Kleinias, when
he was in a bad temper, used to take up his harp, saying,
“I am calming myself.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_689" id="fnanchor_689"></a><a href="#footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></span>
He and his school regarded
the harp as the true means of attaining that peace
and solemn orderliness of soul which as true Dorian
musicians they desired. Lukourgos produced at Sparta
the state of mind necessary to enable his reforms to
be carried, by sending from Crete a lyric poet named
Thales, whose songs, by their calm and orderly tune
and rhythm, were an incentive to discipline and concord:
by this means the Spartans were imperceptibly
calmed in character.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_690" id="fnanchor_690"></a><a href="#footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></span>
The Arcadians, according to
their compatriot Polubios, from ancient times onwards
“made music their foster-brother” from their cradles
till they were thirty years of age, in order to counteract
the brutalising tendencies of their rough life and harsh
climate; and the inhabitants of one district, Kunaitha,
which neglected this preventive, were notorious for
their wickedness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_691" id="fnanchor_691"></a><a href="#footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Thus music came to be regarded as the best means
of forming character. It was only necessary to apply
the right sort of “harmony” to the young and susceptible
personality, and the right “ethos” would be
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
produced. The Dorian was most in request for
educational purposes: its merits were universally
recognised. For it “suitably represented the notes and
accents of a brave man in the presence of war or of any
other violent action, going to meet wounds or death or
fallen into any other misfortune, facing his fate with
unflinching resolution.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_692" id="fnanchor_692"></a><a href="#footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></span>
Of the others, as has been
said, Plato preferred the Phrygian and Aristotle the
Lydian.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Not only beautiful music, but beautiful art also, was
believed to produce, by an unconscious but irresistible
influence, beautiful characters in those who came into
contact with it; while, on the other hand, bad art, as
well as bad music, was the cause of vice and low moral
ideals.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_693" id="fnanchor_693"></a><a href="#footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></span>
This, they naturally thought, was particularly
true in the case of children, who are so sensitive to all
external influences; moreover, it is the early impressions
that make most difference in a man’s life. To serve
this educational end, the Hellenes expected every statue
and painting, as well as every poem and tune, to have
<ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins>, that is, according to Aristotle’s definition,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_694" id="fnanchor_694"></a><a href="#footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></span>
to be
such that its moral purpose was manifest to the average
man. For this purpose Hellenic art had to become
impersonal: the great statues represent a single trait
of character. The smaller individualising traits are
omitted: the single trait chosen is then idealised and
carried to its utmost possible development. This
produced a single and easily intelligible effect. The
frieze on the Parthenon represented the perfect knight
in various attitudes, not So-and-so and Somebody-else.
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
The same idealised abstractions can be traced in the
“Theseus” of the Pediment, and in most of the dramas
of Sophocles.</p>

<p>The realisation of this artistic ideal was made possible
by the fusion of the two currents, Doric and Ionic. At
the end of the sixth century a wave of Doricism passes
over Athens, and the first competent athlete-sculptors
arise there. A second wave came in the middle of the
next century, in the period of Perikles. The Dorian
characteristics now dominate Attic artists alike in poetry,
sculpture, and vase-painting. Aeschylus had possessed
the best traits of the Ionic temperament, chastened by
the great crisis of the Persian wars: his imagination is
half oriental, and he has often been compared to a
Hebrew prophet. But the canons of Sophocles are
purely Doric, as are those of Pheidias. The mixture
of Doric ethics with Ionic imagination produces the
great age of Hellenic art and literature. With art in
such an educative condition, the effect of the great
public buildings and temples, which adorned even quite
humble villages, and of the glorious statues of which
every temple, agora, and gymnasium formed a perfect
treasure-house, must have been very great upon the
Hellenes, who were probably the most susceptible of all
peoples to artistic influences. Moderns vaguely realise
that a great Gothic Cathedral does direct the emotions
quite perceptibly. The more susceptible Athenians
must have been much more strongly influenced by
the Parthenon and the Propulaia. In fact, it is related
that Epaminondas declared that his countrymen could
never become great unless they removed these buildings
bodily to Thebes. Strangers visiting Athens were so
overcome by her architectural glories that they thought
her the natural capital of the world&mdash;an effect which
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
Perikles may well have intended. Great works of art
produce great effects: it is not unnatural to suppose
that smaller works produce a not inconsiderable, if
smaller, effect. Modern theorists often declare that
the pictures and wall-paper of the nursery ought to be
in the best taste. Plato and Aristotle ruled that
everything, however humble, which surrounds the
growing child should be in accordance with the best
canons of art, since art influenced morality so strongly.
“Ought we not to keep an eye,” says Plato,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_695" id="fnanchor_695"></a><a href="#footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></span>
 “on the
craftsmen also, and prevent them from representing
moral evil or disorderliness or bad taste or lack of grace
or lack of harmony either in their imitations of animals
or in their buildings or in any other object of their
craft? If they are unable to carry out our directions
in this matter, ought we not to expel them from the
community, lest boys who are brought up in the bad
pasture of these bad representations may pluck poison
daily from everything around them, and little by little
insensibly accumulate a large amount of evil in their
souls? Must we not rather search for such craftsmen
as are able, by their native genius, to discover what is
beautiful and graceful? For in this way our children,
dwelling in a region of health, will be influenced for
good by every sound and every sight of these works of
beauty, inhaling as it were a healthy breeze that blows
to them from a goodly land.” Every article of
furniture, every detail of architecture, is to take its part
in educating the citizens. But if art and music are so
potent a factor in education, they require to be carefully
regulated: a depravation of popular taste, which
will cause a depravation of the dependent artists,
will by its educating influence increase the national
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
decadence both of taste and of morals, in an ever-widening
degree.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Poetry had at least an equally potent influence upon
contemporary ethics. The works of the great poets
were the chief medium of education, and large quantities
of them were learned by heart in all the elementary
schools.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_696" id="fnanchor_696"></a><a href="#footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></span>
What the boys learned, they then recited,
with as much dramatic action as they were capable of:
the rhapsodes provided them with models. Thus the
boys really <em>acted</em> the poets as far as they could.
Acting was a new thing in Hellas in Solon’s time, and
it was received with apprehension. When Thespis first
acted one of his plays, Solon asked him if he was not
ashamed to tell such lies in public, making himself out
to be what he was not. Thespis replied that it was
only in fun. Then Solon struck the ground with his
stick and said, “We shall soon find this fun of yours
invading our commercial transactions.” Later, when
Peisistratos obtained the bodyguard, to which he owed
his tyranny, by pretending to have been wounded by
his enemies, Solon said the stratagem was a case of
acting.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_697" id="fnanchor_697"></a><a href="#footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></span>
This objection was echoed by Plato, and is
not wholly unjustified by the course of history. For
the great vice of Hellenic life was its insincerity: it is
impossible to tell how far a Hellene is in earnest. It
is this vice which ruins their oratory; it is this which,
in later times, made the “hungry little Greek” the type
of a fawning liar in Roman opinion. It was not only
in recitations that acting played a great part. The
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
dances were essentially dramatic: it was this quality
which enabled them to give birth to the drama. In
the war-dance all the gestures and attitudes of attack
and defence in actual battle were represented. The
Dionysiac dances were originally the acts of devotees
trying to assimilate themselves to the god in his
sufferings and triumphs.</p>

<p>How vividly a Hellene entered into the dramatisation
may be seen from the case of the rhapsode Ion.
When he recited Homer, his eyes filled with water and
his hair stood on end; and his audience were in much
the same condition. The effect in the “Mimetic”
dances, where music, gestures, rhythm, and poetry all
combined to produce a single impression, must have
been greater still; the audience, as well as the performers,
must often have been quite carried away.
Such performances were very frequent. Is it unnatural
to suppose that such frequent assimilation had an
important effect on the Hellenes, with their artistic
temperament and great susceptibility? At any rate,
Plato, Aristotle, and Aristophanes, not to mention lesser
names, believed that it had.</p>

<p>Among these potent poetic influences, the drama
must certainly not be forgotten. Sokrates regarded the
<cite>Clouds</cite> of Aristophanes as a far more deadly attack
upon his career than anything that Anutos and Meletos
could say. To Plato, the theatre plays the part of the
“Great Sophist,” the educating influence which forms
the opinion and the character of the young.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Hellenic poetry enshrined
the religion of the race: this fact gave it an
enormous influence. The characters in Aeschylus and
Sophocles are divine or semi-divine; many of the audience
in the theatre were wont to revere Agamemnon
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
or Theseus; all paid worship to Athena and Apollo.
The Athenian drama was sacred to a Hellene as is the
play at Oberammergau to a Christian. Had Shakespeare
dramatised the Bible, modern children might have
recited his speeches and acted his plays with somewhat
similar feelings to those with which Hellenic boys
recited Homer or Aeschylus. Suppose Shakespeare had
thus dramatised the story of Esau and Jacob, and an
imaginative child was set to learn Jacob’s speeches and
repeat them; suppose he was also in the habit of
hearing them recited by a first-class actor who knew
how to bring out the minuter traits of character.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_698" id="fnanchor_698"></a><a href="#footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></span>
Is
it not, at any rate, quite rational to argue that the
child would gradually absorb some of these traits of
character, just as children often pick up the peculiarities
of nurses and others with whom they have no hereditary
connection? Might not underhand habits be reasonably
attributed to frequent acting of the part of Jacob?
Yet in ancient Hellas the influence was much stronger,
for the people were more susceptible and the characters
were believed to be half-divine.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>Thus in ancient Hellas music, art, and poetry had
an immense effect on the characters and morals of the
race. This influence may well have been exaggerated
by Hellenic thinkers. Damon the musician declared
that every change in artistic standards produced a
change in the tone and constitution of a State; and
Plato agreed with him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_699" id="fnanchor_699"></a><a href="#footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></span>
The danger of such innovations
is a large part of the theme of the <cite>Laws</cite>, and,
in a less degree, of the <cite>Republic</cite>. Sparta accepted
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
this attitude and forbade all change. The opinion
was certainly widely held, and must have rested on
experience.</p>

<p>Just as the thinkers were beginning to realise this
principle, it happened that a very great change in the
artistic canons did take place. Sophocles is succeeded
by Euripides, Pheidias by Praxiteles: music suffers a
similar transformation. Idealism gives way to realism:
Sophocles and Pheidias had represented men as they
ought to be, Euripides and Praxiteles represent them
as they are. Poets and sculptors still pretend to be
delineating deities, but in reality they are delineating
contemporary life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_700" id="fnanchor_700"></a><a href="#footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></span>
Their creations not only cease to
be idealised, they cease to have only a single trait.
The “Hermes” of Praxiteles is a dreamy but vigorous
young Athenian who might have been met in the
Akademeia or Lukeion; the “Herakles” of Euripides is
now a homicidal maniac, now a reckless mercenary.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_701" id="fnanchor_701"></a><a href="#footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></span>
The characters become human by losing their divineness.
In the next generation the divine names are dropped,
and Menander can depict contemporary life without
having to call his characters Orestes or Phaidra. Music
also ceased to be so severely separated off into types.
All manner of musical innovations arise, which it is
very hard for a modern to grasp. But the result is
clear enough. It became no longer possible to detect
the ethical meaning of a tune: music was becoming
complex, just as characters in drama and sculpture were
becoming complex. It was also more homely in subject.
It became daringly “mimetic” also, imitating all the
sounds of nature. This was an age of daring experiments,
and musicians shared the general movement.</p>

<p><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
To the Conservative party in Hellas and to the
educational theorists these changes naturally appeared
ruinous. In their opinion, Euripides was practically
parodying the Bible and making divine characters share
all the follies and weaknesses, and use the homely
language, of mere men. Boys, learning such poetry by
heart, would cease to have ideals: everything would be
commonplace to them. They would recite the most
homely language, and act the most homely parts, under
the idea that they were half-divine. Moreover, with
the attack of the new school upon the old religion, the
more immoral parts of Hellenic mythology were brought
into undue prominence. Euripides seems to have
chosen some questionable subjects; the dithyrambic
poets were worse, and chose themes quite unsuitable for
children to act or hear. And music ceased to have any
ethical value; it was all trills and onomatopœia. Such
changes meant a revolution in the results of education.</p>

<p>The poet Aristophanes is the first to raise his voice
against the change. A few months before the utter
ruin of Athens, he produces the <cite>Frogs</cite>, which really
repeats the attack of the <cite>Clouds</cite>, with Euripides
instead of Sokrates for the defendant. The poet is
attacked as at once the prophet of the new culture of
the Sophists and of the new artistic standards. The
following are some of the chief faults which Aristophanes
finds with the new school represented by Euripides:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_702" id="fnanchor_702"></a><a href="#footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></span>
(1) an undignified style of music, worthy only of the
bones as an accompaniment; (2) its habit of mixing all
sorts of incongruous musical rubbish together, “lewd
love-songs, drinking catches of Meletos, Karian flute-music,
dirges, and dances”; (3) its trills or shakes, as
in <ins title="eieieieieilissete">εἰειειειειλίσσετε</ins>; (4) its mixture of incongruous
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
pictures, “dolphins, spiders, halcyons, prophet-chambers,
and race-courses,” pathos and bathos, commonplace and
solemnity; (5) bad metre, licenses of every sort, and
frequent “resolved” feet. As a parody of its habitual
incongruity Aristophanes gives:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“O God of the sea, that’s what it is. O ye neighbours,
behold yon monstrous deed: Gluke’s gone off
with my cock. Nymphs, ye daughters of the hills!
Mary Ann, lend a hand.”</p>

<p>Aristophanes’ voice comes with a certain pathos, for
the play is the last utterance of Periclean Athens,
just at the point of falling and trying to find a scapegoat
on whom to lay the responsibility of its ruin:
and the scapegoat chosen is the new artistic and musical
standard. The Ionic temperament had, in fact,
broken away from all restraint. The Doric canons of
order, symmetry, regularity, and solidity were thrown
aside. Everything antique was treated with disdain;
all authority was rejected with scorn. No standards,
ethical or artistic, were tolerated. Perpetual change,
daily novelty, became the one desire of Athens. The
foundations of belief, the bases of the moral code, were
broken down. The whole world seemed to be
crumbling away, and nothing was arising to take its
place. Spectators became dizzy with the eternal
fluctuations. What wonder if they turned longing eyes
towards the one centre of gravity in Hellas, towards
the one place where politics, art, and ethics retained
their old stability, towards Sparta? So Sparta becomes
the philosopher’s ideal, and it is the Spartan canon that
Plato tries to reimpose on Ionicism running riot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_703" id="fnanchor_703"></a><a href="#footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></span>
The
fault which he finds with contemporary art and music
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
is that they simply try to please and amuse the audience,
not to educate and improve it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_704" id="fnanchor_704"></a><a href="#footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></span>
They are like parents
who try to soothe a fractious child with sweetmeats
when his health requires castor oil. But the poets and
artists are the slaves of the mob which pays them.
They must be freed from this control, and made the
servants of the government. Strict canons must be
drawn up, which they must follow on pain of being
expelled from the State. The canons must be drawn
up by a select body of experts; the mob is incapable of
judging in such matters; the critic must guide their
taste, not follow it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_705" id="fnanchor_705"></a><a href="#footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></span>
Good music and art must
bear the stamp of a good “ethos,” and, since men
appreciate the character most which most resembles
their own, it will be the good man who will most
appreciate good music:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_706" id="fnanchor_706"></a><a href="#footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></span>
so the good man becomes the
standard. In order to point his moral, Plato sketches
the history of the Athenian drama, showing how its
dependence on popular opinion ruined it<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_707" id="fnanchor_707"></a><a href="#footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“At the time of the Persian wars Athens was a
limited democracy, with the magistracies arranged
according to a property qualification. The spirit of
obedience and discipline prevailed in those days, and was
strengthened by the dread of Persia. The populace
willingly obeyed the laws that fixed the artistic and
musical standards. By these regulations the different
types of song and accompaniment, hymns or prayers to
the gods, lamentations, pæans, dithyrambs, and so forth
were kept quite distinct, no one being allowed to mix
them together; the standard, too, was not fixed, as now,
by the shouts and stampings and confused applause of
the mob, but every one listened in silence until the end
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
of the play, the educated classes from preference, and
boys and their paidagogoi, and the mob generally,
under the direction of the rod. Thus the mass of the
citizens were ready to obey in an orderly manner, not
venturing to make noisy criticisms. In course of time
some poets, who ought to have known better, led the
way in breaking down these laws. Frenzied and distracted
by their desire for pleasure, they mixed lamentations
with hymns and pæans with dithyrambs, they
imitated the flute on the lyre, they confused everything
with everything else. Blinded by ignorance, they lied
and said that there was no question of accuracy of representation
in music: the only standard was the pleasure
of the hearer, whatever sort of man he might be. With
such style of poetry, and arguments to match, they
inspired the many with contempt for the laws of Art,
and gave them the idea that they were capable of
criticising it. So the audience was no longer silent but
noisy, since it supposed that it knew what was good and
what was bad. Art was no longer governed by good
taste, but by the bad taste of the mob. Nor was this
the worst of it. From Art the infection spread to other
spheres, and every one began to think that he knew
everything, and consequently to break the laws. For,
thinking themselves wiser than the laws, they no longer
feared them.… Next comes a refusal to obey the
Archons, then contempt for the orders of parents and
elders, then a desire to be free from the restraints of a
constitution. The end is utter contempt for oaths and
covenants and the gods.”</p>

<p>It is the lack of order and system in contemporary
music which Plato dislikes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_708" id="fnanchor_708"></a><a href="#footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></span>
In modern dances, he
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
complains, manly words are set to effeminate tunes or
gestures, and the voices of men and beasts and instruments
are mixed together into a confused and unintelligible
hodgepodge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_709" id="fnanchor_709"></a><a href="#footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></span>
Music without words is equally
detestable. Music that runs on without the proper
pauses and loves mere speed and meaningless clamour,
using flutes and harps without words, is in the worst
taste. The meaning must be quite plain.</p>

<p>Music must also be good. Poets say much that is
good, much that is bad: they are irresponsible beings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_710" id="fnanchor_710"></a><a href="#footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></span>
The State ought to appoint censors who will reject all
unsuitable poems and tunes and dances. Those which
are already in existence must be selected and expurgated.
If this ruins the poetry, never mind: moral tone is far
more important than poetical skill. In fact, poetry
ought to be written by moral citizens without any
regard being paid to their poetical talents: it would
also be well if they did not compose till they were fifty!<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_711" id="fnanchor_711"></a><a href="#footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></span>
A sketch of a Platonic Censor re-editing Homer is
given in Books <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> and <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> of the <cite>Republic</cite>: his methods
are drastic.</p>

<p>But Plato’s chief denunciation is reserved for the
“mimetic” or imitative aspect of poetry. The poet
teaches “posing.” Homer, when he described the siege
of Troy, is posing as a skilled tactician (as his admirers
often claimed that he was), when really the silence of
history proves that he was nothing of the sort. So too
the painter who represents a plough is posing as an
authority upon agriculture: question him, and he will
prove to be completely ignorant of the subject. Both
poetry and painting are a fraud and a deception; by
their pretence of knowledge, they encourage the mind
in the habit, to which it is so prone, of accepting vague
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
opinions as certainties without testing their truth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_712" id="fnanchor_712"></a><a href="#footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></span>
They foster that belief in the sense-perceptions which
it is the object of Platonic education to destroy.</p>

<p>But the poet not only poses himself: he makes his
audience, his reader, his performer pose. The boy
who recites the dying speech of Aias in Sophocles’ play
is posing as Aias, pretending to be Aias, and adopting
the tone and the traits of Aias. The boy who dances
in the dithyramb <cite>Semelé</cite> is trying to enter into
Semelé’s feelings and moods, being helped by the music
and the gestures and the words.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_713" id="fnanchor_713"></a><a href="#footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></span>
Such posing, if
begun in early years, will invade the character and
change it: the boy will become like the personages
whom he is accustomed to act. Hence Plato lays
down strict laws dealing with the recitations and dances
of the young.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_714" id="fnanchor_714"></a><a href="#footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></span>
 “If they speak in character, it must
only be in the character of those who are, what they
themselves must be when they are grown up, brave,
temperate, pious gentlemen. They must have no skill
in taking unsuitable characters, lest from their dramatic
representation of what is vulgar and base they become
infected with the reality of vulgarity and baseness. For
imitation, if begun in early years and carried far, sinks
into a boy’s habits and nature, and influences his voice,
his gestures, and his ideas.… So boys must not be
allowed to take the character of a woman, young or
old, abusing her husband or blaspheming against the
gods or uttering lamentations,&mdash;certainly not of a
woman in sickness or in love or in pangs; nor the
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
character of slaves performing slavish duties; nor of
bad men, cowards, insulting or mocking one another,
using foul language, drunk or sober; nor yet of madmen.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_715" id="fnanchor_715"></a><a href="#footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></span>
It will be seen that this will exclude much of
Hellenic drama, especially of the plays of Euripides
and Aristophanes. Comedy, according to Plato, should
only be acted by foreigners, and should serve as an
awful warning of everything that a gentleman ought
not to do. The new music is subjected to similar
rules. “Boys must not imitate blacksmiths at the
forge, or craftsmen occupied in any trade, or sailors
rowing, or boatswains giving them orders, or anything
of the sort; nor yet horses neighing, or bulls roaring,
or the noise of rivers or the sea or thunder or wind or
hail or chariot-wheels or pulleys or trumpets or flutes
or pipes …; nor the sounds made by dogs and
sheep and birds.” So the proper style of poetry for
educational purposes will be mostly narrative, with
occasional dramatisation of virtuous men. To accompany
this simplified and purified poetry only the Dorian
and Phrygian “harmonies” will be required: all the
others may be rejected. Simple instruments alone will
be wanted: many-stringed lyres and the flute can be
banished. The seven-stringed lyre and the shepherd’s
pipe will be left.</p>

<p>Plato finds it too difficult to carry these principles
into rhythm, since he is not an expert in the subject.
But he thinks that the metres could be regulated in
accordance with his canons; the expert Damon declared
that some had a demoralising tendency.</p>

<p>As a whole, Plato’s aim is to restore Doric standards,
to combat amateurism and dabbling, by which boys
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
were made Jacks-of-all-trades, and above all to insist
that the refined few ought to set the standard of taste in
matters musical, literary, and artistic, not the unrefined
many. With his view may be contrasted Perikles’
boast to the Athenian people, “We can all criticise
adequately, if we cannot all invent,” and Aristotle’s
belief that a crowd judges better than an individual
because its judgment is compounded of many judgments.</p>

<p>But when we come to Aristotle the creative instinct
of the Hellenic nation, apart from a few gifted
individuals, is dead. To him and his contemporaries
music and painting are no longer rendered necessary
parts of education owing to the irresistible craving
of an artistic temperament for expression. Listen
to his theory. Painting gives boys an eye for
beauty, and prevents them from being cheated in
art-dealing: there is no inward compulsion to paint.
Boys had better learn to sing and play, since children
must needs make a noise. All they really need is the
power of criticising professional music. This power,
unluckily, cannot be acquired without personal study.
But let them drop their music as soon as they can,
or they might be mistaken for vulgar professionals.
Such words could hardly have been addressed to a
nation that was still musical and artistic. So Aristotle’s
æsthetic criticism is really a study of the past, the
discussion of a dead age. He has no natural affinity
for such things himself: he prefers to sum up the
opinions of experts. Consequently his remarks on the
subject are scientific but no more; for a real appreciation
of the Hellenic artistic and musical spirit it is
necessary to go to Plato, who combated it so fiercely
just because he was more in sympathy with it than
suited his philosophic desires.</p>

A poetical education probably develops the imagination at the expense of the
logical mind. Plato is a good instance of this: his imagination, against his will,
outweighs his reason. It may be this personal experience which gives so much

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">XENOPHON: “THE EDUCATION OF KUROS”</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> central figure in many parishes in England is a
retired Major-General or Colonel. He constitutes the
chief pillar of the neighbouring church, reads the
Lessons on Sundays, teaches in the Sunday School,
gives away the prizes at School-treats held in his own
grounds, and heads every subscription list; while his
leisure is given to the compilation of a military memoir
or two, and perhaps, if he is very literary, of a few
short stories. Just such a man was Xenophon. On
retiring from active service, he withdrew to the little
village of Skillous in Elis, where he owned a house and
a park. The whole country swarmed with fish and
game, so that he and his sons could have as much
hunting as they pleased. Guests were numerous, for
past his gates ran the great high-road from Lakedaimon
to Olympia. In his grounds he built a chapel to
Artemis, the expenses being defrayed from a tithe of
the spoils he had taken in the heart of the Persian
Empire. The tenth of the produce of his land was
paid to the goddess, and once a year he gave a great
sacrificial feast in her honour, to which all the neighbours
were invited. In this way the retired General
lived for twenty years, devoted to his religion, his
hunting, and the composition of his books. Having
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
two sons of his own, he naturally gave some attention
to the problems of education. His treatise on the
constitution of Lakedaimon is simply a sketch of the
Spartan school system, no doubt intended for his boys,
who were brought up at Sparta. A curious passage in
his <cite>Economics</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_716" id="fnanchor_716"></a><a href="#footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></span>
shows that he considered the most
effective mode of teaching to be a series of appeals, by
means of question and answer, to personal observation
and common-sense. Ischomachos asks Sokrates whether
he knows how to plant trees. Sokrates at first replies
“No,” but when he is questioned point by point,
whether on his excursions to Lukabettos, he has noticed
the depth of the trenches in the orchards, and some
similar details, and when his common-sense has shown
him that plants grow quicker through soft than
through hard soil, he finds that he is an expert nurseryman,
and decides that questioning must be the way to
teach.</p>

<p>But the most important of Xenophon’s educational
works is the <cite>Education of Kuros</cite>. In this he becomes
the classical Miss Edgeworth and Henty combined. The
book is really an historical novel, mostly fiction, embodying
a moral story for the young, an ideal system of
education, and a practical treatise on the whole duty of
a general. The ideal system comes first, as a sort of
preface, and presents a curious parallel to the rival
schemes of his contemporary Plato. Xenophon makes
the reader suppose that his system was practised in
Persia in the time of Kuros’ boyhood, but there is no
authority for his statement. Persia is in this case a
convenient title for Utopia.</p>

<p>The ordinary State, according to Xenophon, leaves
its citizens to form their own characters; but the
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
Persian system definitely aims at producing virtue. In
every Persian city there is what is called the “Free
Agora.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_717" id="fnanchor_717"></a><a href="#footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></span>
This is an open square, like the ordinary
market-place, but unlike it in being without shops or
booths, for the vulgar bustle and clamour of buying and
selling is forbidden here, as likely to disturb the peace
and calm of the educated. Round it lie the royal palace
and the State buildings, so that it would be a place of
some architectural pretensions and not unlike the quadrangle
of a College at an English University. The
square is divided into four parts&mdash;one for the children,
one for the epheboi, one for full-grown men, and one
for the old; for men of all ages have their place in
this College. Any Persian is at liberty to send his son
to school here, but only the rich can afford to support
their sons while they attend the classes: the poor man’s
children, in Utopian Persia as in modern England, must
needs work for their living at an early age. The schools
are apparently only for boys: Xenophon has nothing to
say here about feminine education, although he approves
of the Spartan system.</p>

<p>All boys under sixteen are ranged together in twelve
companies, according to the number of Persian tribes;
of arrangement in classes by age or intelligence nothing
is said. They have to be in their quarter of the Free
Agora at daybreak. Their education is under the control
of twelve masters chosen from the elder men. What
they learn in school is <em>Justice</em>, as boys elsewhere learn
letters. The system is as curious as the subject. A sort
of miniature law-court is constituted, where the masters
act as judges and the boys accuse one another before
them. The accusations must not be concocted for the
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
occasion, for any one found guilty of bringing a false
charge against a schoolfellow is severely punished.
Smith Major has stolen Brown’s bow and arrows, or
Jones has called Robinson various opprobrious names;
the offenders are hauled up before the tribunal, duly
tried, and, if convicted, flogged.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_718" id="fnanchor_718"></a><a href="#footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></span>
Ingratitude is regarded
as a particularly heinous crime. It appears that
promising pupils were allowed to act as judges sometimes.
The boy Kuros tells his mother how he received
this honour and once gave a wrong verdict, to
his own discomfiture. “The case was like this,
mother,” he is made to say. “A big boy wearing a
small coat met a small boy wearing a big coat, and
compelled him to exchange. I was told to decide the
case, and said that it was best that each should have the
coat which fitted him. Then the master flogged me.
For the point was, To whom did the big coat belong?
not, Whom did it fit best? It belonged to the boy who
bought or made it, not to the boy who took it by force,
breaking the law.”</p>

<p>Besides “Justice,” the children were taught the
properties of plants, in order that they might avoid those
that were harmful and use those which were good.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_719" id="fnanchor_719"></a><a href="#footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></span>
This seems a curious anticipation of “Nature-study,”
with a strictly utilitarian object, and Xenophon deserves
credit for an original suggestion.</p>

<p>The boys are assisted in the formation of good habits
by the sight of their elders in the adjacent quarter of the
Free Agora, setting them an example in temperance and
obedience and self-restraint. They also learn not to be
greedy, by taking their meals, when ordered, in the
school, under supervision, off the very simple fare of
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
bread, water, and a sort of seed resembling the modern
mustard, which is all that they are allowed to bring with
them from home for the purpose. What is more, this
probably constituted the only meal which the children
had on such days. It must have been a pretty stiff
lesson in abstinence! How they would have hated a
master who ordered it too often! For games and
exercise they had shooting with the bow and hurling
the javelin&mdash;that is, military training.</p>

<p>The other three ages are also organised each under
twelve masters in its own quarter of the Agora of Education.
The epheboi, who in Utopia include all from
sixteen to twenty-six, even sleep there, acting as a standing
army and a police force to guard the palace and the
State buildings. Xenophon thinks it well that the men
of this age, who need more attention, in his opinion, than
even the boys, should be always under the eye of the
authorities. They are organised into twelve companies,
one from each of the Persian tribes. Their time is
largely occupied in police-work, such as catching brigands,
and in hunting. Xenophon attaches great importance
to hunting of all sorts, as being the best training
for war.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_720" id="fnanchor_720"></a><a href="#footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></span>
For it involves exposure to heat and cold and
other hardships, training in marching and running, and
skill with bow and javelin;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_721" id="fnanchor_721"></a><a href="#footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></span>
it also requires courage, to
meet the sudden charge of a panther; and long and
patient strategy, to catch birds and hares.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_722" id="fnanchor_722"></a><a href="#footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></span>
So, several
times a month, the king goes out hunting and takes six
companies of the epheboi with him, armed with bows and
arrows, a dagger, a light shield, and two spears&mdash;one for
throwing and one for stabbing. When not engaged in
hunting or in police-work, the epheboi revise what they
learned as boys, and practise shooting, competing with
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
one another; there are also public contests, with prizes.
Prizes are also given to the officer in charge of the
company which shows itself the most intelligent,
courageous, and trustworthy; the master who taught
this company in its school-days is also commended.</p>

<p>The men from twenty-six to fifty occupy the third,
and the elders the fourth, quarter of the Agora. The
former act as a standing army of heavy infantry; the
latter as a reserve force for home defence, as Judges, as
the electors to the offices of State, and as the teachers
of the children. The other offices are filled by the
third age. Any freeborn Persian can climb this four-runged
Ladder of Education to the very top; but no
one may enter a higher class without having served his
full time in those below it. To Xenophon, it appears,
belongs the credit of being the first theorist to recognise
the merits of this Thessalian custom of the “Free
Agora,” the State-provided centre of culture, afterwards
adopted so extensively in Alexandria, where the
educated classes of all ages might meet in an intellectual
atmosphere and amid beautiful surroundings, and
provide that exchange and mart of ideas by personal
intercourse which Newman considered to be the essence
of a University. In the Free Agora of Utopian Persia
all the educated spend their days, influencing one
another by talk and example, exchanging and criticising
ideas, competing in warlike exercises&mdash;and all
in an atmosphere untainted by the vulgarity of money-making.
On the other hand, culture there does not mean
idleness; to Xenophon, as to Plato, education seemed
to entail great responsibilities, and the educated classes
provide the sole standing army of the State and have to
give their countrymen the benefit of their intelligence
by serving as Rulers and Judges.</p>

<p><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
But Xenophon’s University provides only legal and
military instruction; intellectual culture is not recognised
in his “Persia.” The boys learn the principles
of their national law; for, as Xenophon is careful to
proclaim, the Justice which they are taught is no
Platonic elaboration, but simple conformity to the law
of the land.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_723" id="fnanchor_723"></a><a href="#footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></span>
Their other lessons aim solely at the
soldier’s life: this is the object of their severe diet,
their botany, and their training in arms. General
morality is to be imbibed from contact in the Agora with
their exemplary seniors, not by ethical contemplation.
The system has the merit of being extremely practical,
as would be expected from a man of Xenophon’s
stamp. The boys are to be soldiers all their lives, and
Rulers and Judges in their old age. Consequently they
are to be taught only what is essential to this calling.
The soldier must be well versed in the use of arms and
capable of enduring hardships; so the boys are taught
to use the bow and javelin and lead a sternly simple
life. The chief essential to the Ruler and Judge is a
sound knowledge of the national law: the boys are
taught law from the first, in a highly practical way, and
even learn to administer it, acting as judges to their
schoolfellows. No better means could be devised for
teaching boys the legal procedure of their native land
than this of constituting them into a miniature Court.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_724" id="fnanchor_724"></a><a href="#footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></span>
It is a scheme, however, which would be repugnant to
the whole idea of an English public school, where the
boys are expected to fight their own battles and set
their own tone without calling in the master’s assistance
except in grave cases. But the Hellenic boy was never
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
left without supervision: the paidagogos, or some elder,
was always in attendance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_725" id="fnanchor_725"></a><a href="#footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></span>
Probably the chief criticism
which it would have occurred to an Athenian of that
age to urge against Xenophon’s system would be, not
that it encouraged tale-bearing, nor that it failed to
teach self-reliance, but that his countrymen were quite
sufficiently litigious already without any teaching.
The absence of literature and music would also have
seemed a fatal objection.</p>

<p>The “Persian” schools are apparently open, free of
charge, to any boy whose father chooses to send him.
For the only expense which the parents are mentioned
as incurring is the loss of any wages which their son
might have been earning if set to a trade instead of being
sent to school. Xenophon thus institutes free education
without compulsion. Pupils may be withdrawn at any
age; if they or their families have enough private
means to enable them to live in leisure all their lives
they can rise through the various stages to the highest
offices of the State, provided that they are not rejected
as unfit during their upward passage. Theoretically the
educational ladder is open to all; practically it is closed
to all but those who are well-to-do and fairly capable
to boot. But the education provided is not a general
culture, intellectually and morally good for all children,
nor yet utilitarian knowledge, such as arithmetic or
writing, which will serve as a useful, or even necessary,
basis for a trade or profession: it is a strictly
technical education in the work of War and Government.
Few parents, therefore, would send their boys to
Xenophon’s schools, at any rate for a longer period
than would be required for learning just the rudiments
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
of national law and morality, unless they designed them
for a public career.</p>

<p>Thus Xenophon, like his beloved Spartans, has made
war the main object of education, and, like the Romans,
uses law as the chief instrument of instruction. But he
has seen the demerits of the Spartan “Mess-clubs,” and
his boys take their meals and sleep, as a rule, at home;
only the epheboi, as in Crete, dine and sleep always in
the agora. His chief merit is that he recognised that
an educational atmosphere, <ins title="eukosmia tôn pepaideumenôn">εὐκοσμία τῶν πεπαιδευμένων</ins>,
free from the associations of money-making, is essential
to an educational establishment.</p>

<p>After this deeply interesting sketch of Xenophon’s
educational ideals, the <cite>Education of Kuros</cite> becomes a
historical novel with a purpose, an idealised Kuros
acting as example throughout. In Book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> there is the
description of him as the model boy, courteous to his
elders, quick and eager to learn, brave, impetuous,
loved by all, but rather a prig. The description is full
of improving anecdotes and little sermons. The book
concludes with a lecture on the duties of a general,
dealing with tactics and the best means of training
the army and providing supplies. Xenophon puts
all his personal experience into this, and there is plenty
of adventure to make the book palatable to his young
readers.</p>

<p>A few extracts will make the characteristics of this
curious work plain.</p>

<p>When quite young, Kuros went with his mother
Mandané to stay with his grandfather Astuages, King of
Media. The old man, thinking that the boy would be
homesick and wishing to comfort him, sent for him at
dinner the first evening and set all sorts of rich meats
and sauces before him. Then Kuros said, “Grandfather,
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
you must find it a great nuisance, if you have to help
yourself to so many courses and taste so many kinds of
food.” His grandfather replied, “Why, don’t you
think this a much finer dinner than what you get at
home?” “No, grandfather,” replied Kuros; “at home
we satisfy our appetites by a short-cut, just bread and
meat, but here, although your object is the same, you
wind in and out so much on the way that it takes you
ever so much longer to reach it.” “But, my boy, the
delay is only so much pleasure, as you will see if you
try.” Kuros, however, persisted in refusing the unwholesome
dainties, so his grandfather compensated him by
giving him an enormous help of meat. “Is all this
meant for me,” asked Kuros, “to do what I like with?”
“Yes, my boy.” Then Kuros took the meat and distributed
it to the servants who were waiting at table,
saying to one, “This is because you taught me to ride”;
to another, “This is because you gave me a javelin”; to
a third, “This is for waiting on my grandfather so nicely.”
From this example the young reader doubtless learned
not to desire too many courses or too rich sweets at
table, and perhaps also to be grateful to every one, even
servants. After this Kuros remained in Media, while
his mother returned home. “He soon won the love of
his schoolfellows, and quite charmed their parents when
invited to their houses by the affection which he showed
for their sons.” A good moral, this, for little boys who
go out to parties.</p>

<p>This model boy does not die young, but grows up.
He had been rather a chatterbox when small (a warning
to the young readers), but only owing to his desire for
knowledge and his readiness to answer questions;
besides, he chattered in such a nice way that it was a
pleasure to hear him. But as he grew older, he grew
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
more bashful. “He always blushed when he met his
elders, and he talked in a quieter tone. When he
played with his schoolfellows, he chose the games
where he expected to be beaten, not those in which he
expected to win; and he was always ready to lead the
laugh against himself when beaten.” Model youth!
Of course, he soon became the champion at every form
of sport, just as in a modern book of the kind he
would have won at least five “Blues.”</p>

<p>Kuros next appears as a mighty hunter, and then at
the age of fifteen takes a leading part in a battle
against the Assyrians; in fact, it is his strategy and
prowess that decide the day. What more could be
wanted in a book for boys? The modern author
would give him a grizzly bear, a lion, and a <abbr title="Victoria Cross">V.C.</abbr>:
Xenophon gives him the Persian equivalents.</p>

<p>After this, little more is said of Kuros’ boyhood.
He is next introduced as a man of twenty-six, just put
into command of a Persian expedition to help Media
against the Assyrians.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_726" id="fnanchor_726"></a><a href="#footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></span>
Henceforth Xenophon’s object
is no longer to point a moral, but to instruct budding
generals and princes in strategy and government. The
remaining books are a “Handbook of Tactics, with hints
on the proper treatment of inferiors”; so they fitly
begin with a long lecture by Kuros’ father on the
whole duty of a general.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_727" id="fnanchor_727"></a><a href="#footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></span>
There is, however, a good
deal of moral advice and occasional allegory interspersed
amid the tactics. For instance, a certain Gobruas came
to dine with the Persian army. “Seeing how plain the
food was, he regarded the Persians as rather <em>bourgeois</em>.
But then he observed what good manners the guests
had. No educated Persian would allow himself to
be seen staring at a dish, or helping himself hurriedly,
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
or acting at table without proper deliberation. For
they think it piggish to be excited by the presence
of food or drink. He noticed, too, that they never
asked one another questions which might cause pain,
that their jests were never malicious nor their wit rude,
that everything that they did was in the best taste, and
that they never lost their tempers with one another.”
And so on. “Manners for men,” we might call it, by
Xenophon.</p>

<p>A curiously interesting case of allegory, which well
shows how imaginary most of the history is, may be
found in the third book.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_728" id="fnanchor_728"></a><a href="#footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></span>
The son of the king
of Armenia had had for a companion and tutor a
certain Sophist, of whose wisdom he was very proud.
But his father condemned the Sophist for corrupting<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_729" id="fnanchor_729"></a><a href="#footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></span>
the boy. When he was being led to execution, the
man showed what a saint and hero he was by calling
the boy and saying, “Do not be angry with your father
for putting me to death. For it is no wicked purpose
which makes him do it, but only ignorance. All sins
which men commit in ignorance I rank as involuntary
errors.” Later, the father confesses that he put the
Sophist to death for stealing away his son’s affections,
“for I feared that my boy might love him more than
he loved me.” Kuros admits that such jealousy is an
explanation and regards it as pardonable.</p>

<p>The analogy to Sokrates is obvious to any one.
The half-apology for the Athenian people is very
interesting in the mouth of the old Socratic companion
Xenophon.</p>

<p>But the object of the <cite>Education of Kuros</cite> is, after
all, to teach generalship. A couple of examples of the
way in which this is done will suffice. On one
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
occasion<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_730" id="fnanchor_730"></a><a href="#footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></span>
Kuros orders the foot-cuirassiers to lead the
way in a forced march, and kindly explains the object
of such a manœuvre. “This command I give,” he
says, “because they are the heaviest part of the army.
When the heaviest part is in the van, obviously it is
quite easy for the other arms, being lighter, to keep
up. But if the quickest detachment is in front on a
night march, it is not surprising if the army straggles,
for the vanguard goes faster than the rest.” Again,
Kuros could call all his officers by name, to their great
surprise.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_731" id="fnanchor_731"></a><a href="#footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></span>
 “For he thought it very absurd that
tradesmen should know the names of all their tools,
and yet a general should be so stupid as not to know
the names of his officers whom he must use as his
tools in the most serious emergencies. Soldiers who
thought that their general knew their names would,
he considered, be more eager to do heroic deeds in his
presence, and less eager to play the coward. It seemed
also to be foolish to be obliged to give orders, when
he wanted something done, in the way some masters
do in their households, ‘Fetch me some water, Somebody’;
or ‘Cut some firewood, Someone.’ For when
the order is addressed to no one in particular, each
stands looking at his neighbour and expecting him to
carry it out.”</p>

<p>The military part is exceedingly well done. Xenophon
was one of the few good strategists whom Hellas
produced, and his remarks on tactics, the hygiene of an
army, and discipline are sound and useful. What is
more, his novel is interesting and occasionally witty:
it is distinctly good reading. He has disguised his
powder in the most appetising jam, and so has achieved
with success the difficult task of writing a novel with
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
a purpose. Had books been common then, his work
would have been both popular and useful in Boys’
Libraries, and have done good service as a school prize.
But from Plato it only provoked the malicious and not
very deep criticism that it was unhistorical and unsound.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_732" id="fnanchor_732"></a><a href="#footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></span>
“Of Kuros,” he says, “I conjecture that, though he
was a good general and a patriot, he had not come
across the merest scrap of sound education, and never
applied his mind to the art of managing a household.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_733" id="fnanchor_733"></a><a href="#footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></span>
For, being absent on campaigns all his life, he allowed
the women to bring up his children. The women
spoilt the boys, letting no one gainsay them, and
made them effeminate, not teaching them the Persian
habits or their father’s profession, but Median luxury.
Hence the collapse of Persia under Kambuses.”</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">CONCLUDING ESSAY: THE SCHOOLS OF HELLAS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> preceding chapters have sufficiently established, as
it seems to me, that Hellenic education alike at Sparta
and at Athens, in theory and in practice, aimed at producing
the best possible citizen, not the best possible
money-maker; it sought the good of the community,
not the good of the individual. The methods and
materials of education naturally differed with the conception
of good citizenship held in each locality, but
the ideal object was always the same.</p>

<p>The Spartan, with his schoolboy conception of life,
believed that the whole duty of man was to be brave,
to be indifferent to hardships and pain, to be a good
soldier, and to be always in perfect physical condition;
when his Hellenic instincts needed æsthetic satisfaction,
he made his military drill into a musical dance and
sang songs in honour of valour. Long speaking and
lengthy meditation he regarded with contempt, for he
preferred deeds to words or thoughts, and the essence
of a situation could always be expressed in a single
sentence. This Spartan conception of citizenship fixed
the aim of Spartan education. Daily hardships, endless
physical training, perpetual tests of pluck and endurance,
were the lot of the Spartan boy. He did not
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
learn to read or write or count; he was trained to
speak only in single words or in the shortest of
sentences, for what need had a Spartan of letters or of
chattering? His imagination had also to be subordinated
to the national ideal: his dances, his songs, his
very deities, were all military.</p>

<p>The Athenian’s conception of the perfect citizen was
much wider and much more difficult of attainment.
Pluck and harmony of physical development did not
satisfy him: there must be equal training of mind and
imagination, without any sacrifice of bodily health.
He demanded of the ideal citizen perfection of body,
extensive mental activity and culture, and irreproachable
taste. “We love and pursue wisdom, yet avoid bodily
sloth; we love and pursue beauty, yet avoid bad taste
and extravagance,” proclaims Perikles in his summary
of Athenian ideals. Consequently Athenian education
was triple in its aims; its activities were divided
between body, mind, and taste. The body of the
young Athenian was symmetrically developed by the
scientifically designed exercises of the palaistra. At
eighteen the State imposed upon him two years of
physical training at public cost. In after life he could
exercise himself in the public gymnasia without any
payment; there was no actual compulsion, except the
perpetual imminence of military service, which, however,
almost amounted to compulsion.</p>

<p>As to mental instruction, every boy had to learn
reading, writing, arithmetic, and gain such acquaintance
with the national literature as these studies involved.
The other branch of primary education, playing and
singing, intended to develop the musical ear and taste,
was optional, but rarely neglected. The secondary
education given by the Sophists, rhetors, and philosophers
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
was only intended for the comparatively few
who had wealth and leisure.</p>

<p>Taste and imagination were cultivated in the music- and
art-schools, but the influences of the theatre, the
Akropolis, the temples and public monuments, and the
dances which accompanied every festival and religious
occasion, were still more potent, and were exercised
upon all alike. This æsthetic aspect of education was
regarded as particularly important in Hellas owing to
the prevalent idea that art and music had a strong
influence over character.</p>

<p>For the training of character was before all things
the object of Hellenic education; it was this which
Hellenic parents particularly demanded of the schoolmaster.
So strongly did they believe that virtue could
be taught, that they held the teacher responsible for any
subsequent misdemeanour of his pupils. Alkibiades
and Kritias had ruined Athens: they were Sokrates’
pupils: therefore execute Sokrates; this seemed perfectly
logical to an Athenian. If a Sophist sued a
defaulting pupil for an unpaid bill, he was regarded as
ridiculous, for it was his business to teach justice, and
if those who had learned under him behaved unjustly,
it was clearly because his teaching had been worthless.</p>

<p>Since the main object of the schools of Hellas was
to train and mould the character of the young, it would
be natural to suppose that the schoolmasters and every
one else who was to come into contact with the boys
were chosen with immense care, special attention being
given to their reputation for virtue and conduct. At
Sparta this principle was certainly observed. Education
was controlled by a paidonomos, selected from the
citizens of the highest position and reputation, and the
teaching was given, not by hired foreigners or slaves,
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
but by the citizens themselves under his supervision.
But then the teaching at Sparta dealt mostly with the
manners and customs of the State, or with bodily and
military exercises, known to every grown man, and the
citizens had plenty of leisure. The Athenians were in
a more difficult position. There were more subjects
for the boy to learn, and some of them the parents
might have neither the capacity nor the time to teach.
Owing also to the day-school system at Athens and the
peculiarities of Hellenic manners, the boys needed
some one always at hand to take them to and from
school and palaistra. Thus both paid teachers and
attendants were needed. But it was also necessary not
to let education become too expensive, lest the poor
should be unable to afford it. Consequently the
paidagogoi came often to be the cheapest and most
worthless slaves, and the schoolmasters as a class to be
regarded with supreme contempt. No doubt careful
parents chose excellent paidagogoi, schoolmasters, and
paidotribai for their sons, and made the choice a matter
of much deliberation: the teachers at the best schools
and palaistrai were often men of position and repute.
But that the class as a whole was regarded with
contempt there can be little doubt. The children went
into a school as they would have gone into any other
shop, with a sense of superiority, bringing with them
their pets, leopards and cats and dogs, and playing
with them during lesson-times. Idlers and loungers
came into the schools and palaistrai, as they came into
the market-booths, to chatter and look on, seriously
interrupting the work. The schoolmasters and paidotribai
at Athens were, in fact, too dependent upon their
public for subsistence to take a strong line, and, in
spite of their power, often exercised, of inflicting
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
corporal punishment, they seem to have been distinctly
at the mercy of the pupils and their friends. The paidagogoi
too, though they seem to have kept their pupils
in order, were often not the right people to control a
boy’s conduct; they were apt to have a villainous
accent, and still more villainous habits. It must be
confessed that the Athenians, in their desire to make
education cheap, ran a very great risk of spoiling what
in their opinion was its chief object, the training of
character.</p>

<p>Otherwise, they sought this end whole-heartedly.
The games, physical exercises, and hardships of a boy’s
life were meant to develop his pluck, fortitude, and
endurance. For, according to the Hellenic view, now
too much neglected in many quarters, the condition and
treatment of the body had a very important effect both
upon mental activities and upon character. It was for
this reason that physical training formed at least half of
every system of education practised in Hellenic states
or recommended by Hellenic philosophers. A National
School which trained the minds only, and neglected the
bodies of the pupils, would have been inconceivable to
a Hellene. It was not merely that physical infirmities
interrupted the free exercise of thought, or led to
peevishness and lack of decision. Man was a whole to
the Hellenes, and one part of him could not be sound
if the other parts were not. So strongly did they hold
this opinion, that they more than half believed that
physical beauty was a sign of moral beauty; it was this
latent idea which added an additional significance to the
exercises of the palaistra with their symmetrical development
of the body, and to the competitions for manly
beauty which were prevalent throughout the country;
it lent, moreover, a nobler aspect to that passion for
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
the outward loveliness of youth which the vases,
sculpture, and literature of ancient Hellas reveal so
surprisingly. But, besides this vaguer and more
doubtful connection with character, bodily exercise and
development were supposed to have a special and indubitable
effect in strengthening the resolution and
will-power. The object of physical training was only
in a minor degree to keep the body in good condition;
its main aim was to develop strength of character,
determination, fortitude, endurance, pluck, and energy.
But, in accordance with that Hellenic canon of
“moderation in all things,” which was worked out so
thoroughly by Aristotle, there might be too much, as
well as too little, of all these ethical qualities. Consequently
physical exercise must be taken only in due
moderation, and carefully balanced by artistic and
musical training, which militated in an opposite
direction, leading, if pursued in excess, to weakness of
character, indecision, effeminacy, cowardice, and sloth.
A scientifically arranged symmetry between the two
would produce the perfect character.</p>

<p>In the literary and æsthetic schools there were two
elements of the subjects taught, both with an ethical
effect, matter and form. The literature studied in the
schools was expected to be full of improving suggestions
and life-histories of heroes worthy of imitation, couched
in the form most attractive to young minds, in order
that they might appreciate and love its teaching and
examples. The music which the boys played or heard,
the songs which they sang, the dances which they performed
or watched, the art which they copied or
observed, must be such as would influence their
characters for good&mdash;mould them, that is, in accordance
with the national ideal. For Hellenic morality was
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
æsthetic; they followed the course which appealed to
their imagination and sense of beauty. It was therefore
the object of education to make the children see
and feel beauty in virtue, and good art in good ethics,
in order that they might find satisfaction for their
æsthetic cravings&mdash;the dominant instinct of a Hellene&mdash;in
living good and upright lives.</p>

<p>For the unanimous feeling of Hellas based ethics
not upon duty, but upon happiness&mdash;upon the satisfaction,
that is, of the instincts. But this eudæmonistic
attitude was qualified by an important consideration
which is often forgotten. Owing to the solidarity of
Hellenic life, the happiness which was sought was
primarily not that of the individual but that of the
community. The readiness of the average Hellene,
during the best period of the country, to sacrifice everything
on behalf of his city is very remarkable. The
real, if unformulated, basis of his ethics came thus to be
not personal pleasure, but duty to the State. When the
individualism of the Socratic age overthrew this basis,
the Hellenes fell back from the happiness of the State
to the happiness of the self, and both patriotism and
personal morality suffered from the change.</p>

<p>It was the sense of duty to the State, the resolution
to promote the happiness of the whole citizen-body,
which made parents willing to undergo any sacrifice in
order to have their sons educated in the way which
would best minister to this ideal. The bills of the
masters of letters and music and of the paidotribai, and
the lengthy loss of the son’s services in the shop or on
the farm in Attica, the break-up of family life at Sparta,
must have been a sore trial to the parents and have
involved many sacrifices. Yet there is no trace of
grumbling. The Hellene felt that it was quite as much
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
his duty to the State to educate her future citizens
properly as it was to be ready to die in her cause, and
he did both ungrudgingly. If the laws which made
the teaching of letters compulsory at Athens fell into
desuetude, it was only because the citizens needed no
compulsion to make them do their duty. Nor had the
State to pay the school bills; for every citizen, however
poor, was ready to make the necessary sacrifices of
personal luxuries and amusements in order to do his
duty to the community by having his children properly
taught. The State only interfered to make schooling
as cheap and as easy to obtain as possible.</p>

<p>The solidarity of Hellenic life, which converted
eudæmonism into patriotism, was carefully encouraged
by the educational system. Sparta, with this object,
invented the boarding-school, where boys learnt from
early years to sink their individualities in a community
of character and interests. The Athenians and most of
the other Hellenes, on the other hand, had day-schools.
This fact might seem to militate against the principle
which I have stated. But Hellenic custom qualified
the system of day-schools in a particular way. There
were no home-influences in Hellas. The men-folk lived
out of doors. The young Athenian or Ephesian from
his sixth year onwards spent his whole day away from
home (excepting possibly for an interval for the mid-day
meal), in the company of his contemporaries, at
school or palaistra or in the streets. When he came
home, there was no home-life. His father was hardly
ever in the house. His mother was a nonentity, living
in the women’s apartments; he probably saw little of
her. His real home was the palaistra, his chief
companions his contemporaries and his paidagogos.
He learned to dissociate himself from his family and
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
associate himself with his fellow-citizens. No doubt he
lost much by this system, but the solidarity of the State
gained.</p>

<p>The duties of citizenship were also impressed upon
the boys in other and more direct ways, especially its
supreme duty, at any rate in those days, of military
service. The schools of Sparta and Crete were one
long training for war. The other States set apart two
years of the boy’s life, those from eighteen to twenty,
as a period of conscription, during which he was at the
service of his city and under the orders of the military
authorities, learning tactics and the use of arms, and
being practised in the life of camps and forts. The
young recruit took a solemn oath of allegiance to his
country and its constitution: the sacredness of his civic
duties was impressed upon him from the first. The
first function of his new officers was to take him on a
personally conducted tour, so to speak, of the national
temples, that he might realise something of the religious
life and history of his country. His weapons were
solemnly presented to him in the theatre of Dionusos,
before the assembled people; they were sacred, and to
lose them in battle or disgrace them by cowardice was
not only dishonourable, it was impious. Nor were the
boys allowed to grow up in ignorance of the constitution
of their city: the ephebos of eighteen had to be
acquainted with the laws, some of which he had
probably learnt in the music-school, set to a tune.
Every means was taken of making the boys realise that
they were members of a community, to whose prosperity
and happiness their own advantage or pleasure must be
subordinated. In this way grew up the strong Hellenic
sense of an obligation of utter self-sacrifice on behalf of
the State.</p>

<p><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
But education had also to consult the happiness of
the children as well as the happiness of the community,
although in a lesser degree. This may seem a startling
statement to make with regard to Spartan education.
Nevertheless, I believe it to be strictly true. It must
be remembered that all our accounts of the rigours and
horrors of Spartan methods come from Athenian writers
who in all probability had never been to Lakedaimon.
Xenophon, who had his sons educated there, gives a
much milder, and wholly eulogistic, account. The
somewhat hedonistic Attic visitor must have watched
Spartan games and exercises with much the feelings of a
French visitor at an English public school; he found
it difficult to realise that the boys underwent such hardships
of their own free will. Then we must remember
what the Spartan boys were. They were a picked breed
of peculiar toughness, strength, and health; for centuries
every invalid had been exposed at birth or rejected
as incapable of the school-system. Generation after
generation had been trained to be thick-skinned and
stout-hearted; pluck and endurance were hereditary,
and asceticism was a national characteristic. The whole
system, with its perpetual fighting, its rough games, its
hardships, its fagging and “roughing-it” in the woods, is
just what boys of this sort might be expected to evolve
for themselves because they liked it. I have already
pointed out, in my account of the Spartan schools, how
very similar are many of the customs which grew up at
the older English public schools, mainly on the boys’
own initiative. If English boys, brought up on the
whole much less roughly, evolved such customs of their
own free will, the young Spartans may reasonably be
supposed to have accepted them gladly. One significant
token of this survives. The violent and sometimes
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
fatal floggings of the epheboi at the altar of Artemis
Orthia were entirely voluntary on the part of the
victims; yet there was no lack of candidates even in
Plutarch’s days. The Spartan school-system was, in
fact, an exact expression of the national characteristics,
and accordingly was entirely acceptable to the Spartan
boys.</p>

<p>That the Athenian system was designed to suit the
wishes of the Athenian children is less difficult to
establish. It is only necessary to think what the
primary schools were like. When once the letters and
rudiments of reading and writing had been mastered,
the process perhaps being aided by metrical alphabets
and dramatised spelling, the boys began to read, learn
by heart, and write down the fascinating stories of
adventure and the romantic tales of Homer. There
was no grammar to be studied; that, when invented,
came at a later age as a voluntary subject. There were
no years wasted over “Primary Readers” consisting of
dull and second-rate stories. The boys began at once
upon the best and most attractive literature in their
language, and it remained their study for many years,
and was still remembered and loved in after life. Nor
can it be doubted that the music- and art-schools were
attractive to Athenian boys, sons of a people who filled
their whole city with art, and made their year a round
of musical festivals. A large part, too, of Athenian
schooling was what now would be called play; for the
Hellene recognised the importance of physical exercise
in the upbringing of the young, and included it in his
conception of education.</p>

<p>The effect upon Hellenic culture of thus making
education attractive was far-reaching. Instead of
regarding with aversion or a bored indifference the
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
subjects which they had studied at school, the Hellenes
had an affection for them and continued to practise and
improve themselves in them. Throughout their lives
they were eager to hear recitations of Homer. At
banquets they sang the songs and played the music on
the lyre which they had learnt at school. Elderly men
would return to a music-master, to improve their style,
or rush off to hear a Sophist lecture on geography or
astronomy. The exercises of the palaistra were pursued
till old age made them impossible. Grown citizens
retained throughout an affection for education, and went
on educating themselves all their lives. Thus an
Hellenic city formed a centre of widely diffused culture,
a home where literature and art and music and research
could flourish surrounded by appreciation and capable
criticism. Children, too, seeing how much their
elders were preoccupied with education, found it even
more attractive than its designers had made it, since
they were not constrained by nursery-logic to see in it
one of the plagues of youth from which “grown-ups”
were set free. No doubt the Hellenic schoolmaster
was much assisted in his endeavour to make education
attractive by the intellectual curiosity which was a
feature of all those States where the intellect was
systematically trained. The young Athenian or young
Chian was exceedingly eager to learn. In fact, his
eagerness was excessive; he was too much in a hurry;
he desired to have his information given to him ready-made,
not having the patience to think or to undertake
researches on his own account. Hence the phenomenal
success and educational unsoundness of those prototypes
of the modern “crammer,” the Sophists, who supplied
their pupils with a superficial knowledge of many subjects
ready-made, and already dressed in striking phraseology.
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
This intellectual appetite for the accumulation
of facts made secondary education at Athens attractive
without much effort on the part of the teachers, but it
was not allowed to influence the primary schools; a
sound and symmetrical development of mind and body,
artistic taste and moral character, had to precede the
accumulation of facts. This latter stage too was
universally treated as optional. In unintellectual
districts it found no place, and even in Athens it was
only for those who felt a desire for it; it was not forced
upon the unwilling and incapable. For education was
regarded as the development of the latent powers of
the individual personality, it was no vain attempt to
excite or implant non-existent faculties. Every one had
a body, which he must make as efficient as possible, for
the service of the State; every one, in an æsthetic people,
had a taste which could be developed; every one had
enough intellect to learn his letters; and every one,
above all, had a character to be formed. But not
every one could be an international athlete or a first-class
artist or musician, and not every one had sufficient
mental gifts to combine the accumulation of facts with
profit or enjoyment.</p>

<p>In fact, Hellenic sentiment was distinctly adverse to
great development in any one direction: the Hellenes
had a reasonable horror of undue specialisation at school.
The object of education was to make symmetrical,
all-round men, sound alike in body, mind, character,
and taste, not professional athletes who were mentally
vacuous and without any appreciation of art, nor great
thinkers of stunted physique, nor celebrated musicians
who lacked brains. Opponents of the Spartan system
tried to condemn it on this ground, as a specialisation
intended only to produce good soldiers; but the
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
pro-Spartans seemed to have claimed in return that it
developed both character and good taste in judging art
and music, even if it produced small capacity for painting
or playing, while Laconian terseness involved a greater
depth of mental exercise than Athenian verbosity.</p>

<p>Thus Hellenic education was not intended to produce
professional knowledge of a single subject; such
technical instruction was deemed unworthy of the name
of education, and was excluded from the schools. The
subjects studied were for the most part a means, not
an end. Just as a walk is sometimes taken not for the
sake of reaching any particular place, but in order to
keep the muscles of the body in good condition, so
education in Hellas was meant to develop and exercise
the muscles of mind, imagination, and character, not to
inculcate so-called “useful” information. The literature
read at school was imaginative poetry, like that of Homer
or Simonides, not the practical prose treatises upon
Agriculture and Economics which utilitarian motives
would have demanded. For the poetry was both attractive
to the boys and improving for their characters,
while the handbooks, however excellent, only enhanced
their financial prospects. The immediate future of the
individual boy may, it is true, depend somewhat largely
upon the utilitarian knowledge which he has learnt at
school, although a sound education in the Hellenic sense
of the word will prove more advantageous to him in
the long run; but the future of a State depends upon
the character of its citizens. Thus a truly national
education like that of Sparta or of Athens seeks to train
the characters of the future citizens; having formed
their characters, it leaves them with well-justified confidence
to gain what technical instruction they need for
themselves. At a national crisis it was not skill in trade
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
or profession, not good cobbling, nor good weaving,
that Athens required of her citizens; but pluck, energy,
self-sacrifice, obedience, and loyalty. Money was, it is
true, required for building the triremes and for fortifying
the city: it was therefore well that Athenian trade
and manufactures should prosper. But Athens recognised,
and rightly, that her financial resources would be
better served if she trained her boys to be industrious
and thrifty and ascetic, if she made it repugnant to their
taste to fling their money away upon luxury and self-indulgence,
than if she founded the finest system of
technical instruction possible.</p>

<p>But whether Sparta and Athens could have ignored
technical and utilitarian subjects so wholly in their
schools, if they had been educating the whole population
of the State, is another question. It must be
remembered that the Spartan and Athenian citizens who
attended the schools were only a fraction of the
inhabitants of Laconia and Attica. They corresponded
pretty closely to the upper classes, the aristocracy and
gentlemen, of a modern State. The bulk of the middle
and lower classes in a Hellenic State were either foreign
immigrants, who possessed no civic rights and did not
usually attend the schools, or serfs and slaves. Athens,
like mediæval Florence, was only a democracy in the
very limited sense that her full citizens&mdash;a governing
class, that is, and a mere fraction of the population&mdash;had
equality of civic rights among themselves: the rest
had no rights at all. Sparta was a “mixed constitution”;
but that did not mean that the middle and lower classes,
the Perioikoi and Helots, had any share in it whatever.</p>

<p>Consequently education in Hellas is the education of
a small upper class, not of the whole population of the
State. The schools of Hellas were not necessarily for
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
the wealthiest inhabitants of the country, for there were
plenty of rich Metoikoi and poor citizens at Athens;
not necessarily for the boys who had most leisure, for
the sausage-seller goes to school as well as a Nikias or
Alkibiades; but for a hereditary aristocracy of birth,
for that is what Hellenic “citizenship” means. The
boys who attended the lessons of Dionusios or Elpias
were the sons and grandsons of a cultured class, no
matter how humble their circumstances might be; their
families had lived in Attica, they believed, from time
immemorial, and were probably descended from the
local deities. They had the views of an hereditary
caste, including a certain preoccupation with physical
and military activities, and a contempt for trade.</p>

<p>For the duties of such an aristocracy did not consist
in heaping up riches; their position was comparatively
independent of their financial successes. Their work
was, in brief, to govern and to fight. They composed
the electorate of the State, which chose the magistrates;
they alone were members of the public Assembly; they
alone were eligible for office. They sat as dikastai&mdash;jurymen
and justices in one&mdash;in the law-courts; they
made the laws and they administered them. The
national honour and morality lay in their hands, for
they controlled alike the foreign and the home policy
of the State. They formed, too, the cultured circle
which governed natural taste; it was their criticism
which shaped the art of the vase-painters, the architects,
the sculptors, the bronze-makers, and the countless
other artistic tradesmen, the style of the orators, the
literature of dramatists and dithyrambists, the music
of the choric composers. When governors and administrators
were needed for the outlying districts of
the Athenian or Spartan Empires, or if officers were
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
required to lead local levies to battle, any citizen, rich
or poor, might be sent. The citizens, too, formed the
core of the fleets and armies in the best days of Hellas.
The object of Hellenic education was to produce this
type of citizen&mdash;a man capable of governing, of fighting,
and of setting the taste and standards of his country.</p>

<p>Thus the schools of Hellas correspond in England
not to the national schools, but to the “public schools.”
I do not mean to assert that the English public-school
boy stands, in after life, in the position of the Hellenic
citizen to the bulk of the population. English democracy
rests on a wider basis than Athenian or
Florentine, and, in theory at any rate, the exclusive
power of the “upper classes” is at an end. None the
less it is true that from among the boys educated at
the public schools comes a very considerable part of
the generals and military officers, of the clergy, of the
squires, of the Justices of the Peace and other administrators
of the law, of the governors and officials
required by the Indian Empire and the various
dependencies and Crown Colonies, of the members of
Parliament and statesmen at home. If the influence of
the public schools of England upon the governing and
fighting of the nation is less than that which the schools
of Hellas were able to exercise, their influence upon
national taste and standards in art and culture and
literature is probably in no way inferior. It is therefore
their duty to train their pupils’ characters, that they
may be fit and able administrators, governors, and
justices; and their tastes, that their criticism and demands
may rightly direct the culture of the nation.
In striving after these ends, the public schools of
England may, I think, take not a few hints from the
like-motived schools of Hellas.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
